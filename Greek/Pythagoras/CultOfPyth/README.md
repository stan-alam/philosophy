The Cult of Pythagoras: Math and Myths

In my efforts to emphasize the importance of using primary sources, I carried out many of the translations from sources in French, German, and Italian. Latin and Greek are beyond my level of competence, so in many cases I used published translations for ancient languages. Nevertheless, wherever word choices seemed important (as in the ambiguous ancient sources that refer to Pythagoras in relation to mathematics), I did painstakingly translate ancient passages from Latin and Greek.

καί θῦσαί φησιν αὐτὸν ἑκατόμβην ἐπὶ τῷ εὑρηκέναι ὅτι τριγώνου
 ὀρθογωνίου ἡ τὴν ὀρθὴν γωνίαν ὑποτείνουσα τείνουσα ἴσον δύναται
 ταῖς περιεχούσαις:
 ἡνίκα Πυθαγόρης τὸ περικλεὲς εὕρετο γράμμα,
 κλεινὸς ἐφ᾽ ᾧ κλεινὴν ἤγαγε βουθυσίην.


he even sacrificed a hecatomb when he found out that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares of the two sides containing 

 hecatomb, and he changed the ambiguous γράμμα for a “problem” to be solved. It sounds plausible, but that is not what the original says.* The present book asks: how does history change when we subtract the many small exaggerations and interpolations that writers have added for over two thousand years?


 The Secret claims that Pythagoras knew the secret to happiness, the powerful law of attraction: that you can get what you want by thinking about it. Less recently, in one of the most popular science books ever, Carl Sagan noted that on the island of Samos local tradition says that their native son Pythagoras was “the first person in the history of the world to deduce that the Earth is a sphere.

John Wood, having studied megalithic ruins such as Stonehenge, concluded that they were “a Model of the Pythagorean World,” that such stones were set by druids who followed the main priest of Pythagoras.1
 But none of this is true: there’s no evidence for it. This book is about the evolution of myths in the history of mathematics. It’s also about invention, 

about how writers create imaginary histories of their favorite topics. The case of Pythagoras shows a common mismatch between speculations and evidence in history. For the public at large his name is the most famous name in mathematics: millions of people who have never heard about Euler, Gauss, or Galois have nevertheless heard about Pythagoras. But strangely, there’s hardly any evidence that he contributed anything to mathematics. How did this leader of a small and secretive religious cult become world famous in mathematics? A series of great achievements were attributed to him for two thousand years.

that his cult murdered Hippasus for discovering irrational numbers; that Euler was confused about multiplying imaginary numbers; that the bright boy Gauss instantly added the integers from 1 to 100; that Galois created group theory on the night before he died in a pistol duel; that the golden ratio is the most beautiful number, loved by the ancients; and more.

stories are partly true, others are entirely false, but they all show the power of invention in history. These stories grow in the writings of mathematicians, educators, famous scientists, and in Disney and  The Da Vinci Code. By reflex, writers and teachers stretch the meaning of what they read. They add meaning, supposedly hidden but essential.
 This book is also about invention in a very positive sense. People usually view mathematical breakthroughs as a series of discoveries. They assume that numbers and rules existed timelessly, before being discovered. But why?


William Rowan Hamilton and Georg Cantor believed they had discovered numbers that had existed forever. Gottfried Leibniz and Abraham Robinson believed instead that the new numbers they described were essentially fictions, invented.


Paul Lockhart has argued that mathematics is a creative art and that teachers should teach its important aspects that are

Most students learn the principles of math dogmatically, like articles of faith. Lockhart complains:
 “Students are taught to view mathematics as a set of procedures, akin to religious rites, which are eternal and set in stone. The holy tablets, or Math Books, are handed out, and the students learn to address the Church elders as ‘they.’ (As in ‘What do they want here? Do they want me to divide?’)”2
 Incidentally, a mathematics editor told me what her young son once said to a question about his family’s religion: “My dad is Christian, my mom is Mathematician.”

’s a well-kept secret: actually, mathematicians sometimes disagree. They’ve disagreed about what is possible and impossible, they’ve disagreed about what counts as a proof, they’ve even disagreed about the results of certain operations, and most often, they disagree about the meaning of mathematical concepts. Why keep this interesting secret from students? Some mathematicians might deny that this

In 2001, the magazine  Physics World ran a poll on the philosophical views of physicists. Among various questions, about the reality of electrons, genes, atoms, emotions, and light waves, the survey also asked about beliefs regarding numbers. Some respondents wrote “not sure” about some questions; a few just didn’t reply. But many physicists did submit their answers, and a total of 534 replies were received.3
Note: important

The author of the poll, philosopher and historian of science Robert Crease, acknowledged that the word “real” has various meanings to different people. But generally, people view something as real if they think that it exists in the world independent of human perceptions and thoughts. It’s interesting that out of hundreds of respondents, most of them physicists, less than half of them regard imaginary numbers as real.
 It would be revealing to carry out the same kind of poll with mathematicians. Some might think that the question of whether real or imaginary numbers are “real” is meaningless. But I disagree: I think that certain aspects of mathematics are made by our imaginations, and others describe relations that exist independently.

1.  Triangles existed before humans and will continue to exist forever. True or false?


Circles are ______  real than apples. (Less? equally? more?) Students kindly disregard the grammatical incoherence in the second query and just answer the questions. From 2005 to 2010, undergraduate students in thirteen groups answered surveys including these questions, the results of which can be seen below. Out of 245 majors in mathematics and the sciences over those five years, 77 percent of the students wrote that triangles existed before humans and will continue to exist forever. Almost 22 percent disagreed, and only 3 students chose not to reply and wrote instead “maybe,”

Note: Important

However, if it’s false that triangles are eternal, if perhaps triangles are concepts invented by humans, then we should discuss the value of fiction in the elements of mathematics.


Out of 245 students, the great majority claimed that circles and apples are equally real, while roughly 1 out of every 4 said that circles are less real, and only 2 students gave no answer. Eleven students said that circles are  more real than apples, which resembles Plato’s ancient philosophy: the notion that mathematics describes a realm of changeless, eternal ideas that are more real than material things, which take shape but later dissolve.

. Every year I meet some students who think that science has no connection to mathematics. They actually say it: “I don’t see why we have to study science—I’m a  math major.” I’ve heard such words several times: it’s not a random comment, but it makes sense given the old popular-ity of the so-called Platonist philosophy, despite a recent downturn.

John Allen Paulos, “It is almost always possible to present an intellectually honest and engaging account of any field, using a minimum of technical apparatus.
 This is seldom done, however, since most priesthoods (mathematicians included) are inclined to hide behind a wall of mystery and to commune only with their fellow priests.”4


certain delights in conjectures. A friend has a tattoo of what a classics professor once seriously told her:  History is fiction. Likewise, another friend told me what she always liked about history, what was fun about it, “that you get to fill in the blanks.” There are also delights in confusions. A friend of a friend sent me an anecdote that nicely shows how easily people confuse moments of “discovery.” In 2008 he was teaching a class at a language institute, one of the best in Beirut. They were discussing “genius,” and he made a reference to Einstein.

 prominently on center stage at first, but later he will recede to lurk in the background. He will emerge as the patron saint of the urge to pretend to know the past. Now let’s take a look at the creeping shadow of the elusive Pythagoras.
 The Cult of Pythagoras


Legends say that in ancient times a secretive cult of vegetarians was led by a man who had a strange birthmark on his thigh and who taught that we should not eat beans. He believed that when a person dies, the soul can be 
Note: 04

reborn in another body, even as an animal. So he said that we should not eat animals because they might be our dead relatives or friends. And he said that he had been born five times, even before the Trojan War. And when he died his fifth death, his followers later said that he was reborn again. But why should we not eat  beans? His reason: that if a bean is moistened and placed in a pitcher and buried, when we dig it up days later we will find a disturbingly familiar form growing: the head of a human child.1

Note: 05

But wait. There is no evidence that he discovered that. It was already well known to the Hindus and the Chinese.3 And the Babylonians knew it more than a thousand years before Pythagoras was born on the island of Samos in the Aegean Sea.
 Some people say instead that Pythagoras was the first to  prove that the theorem is true for all triangles. But again, is there any evidence that he did that? Lacking evidence that he really did what gives him worldwide fame,  1

If Pythagoras wrote anything, none of his writings seems to have survived. What remains was written long after his death. We don’t trash it all because

 various fragments are mutually consistent and because some reliable commentators apparently wrote some passages. Ancient sources don’t say that Pythagoras proved the hypotenuse theorem, but they do say that he didn’t eat beans and that he believed that souls are reborn.
 They also tell other stories. For example, that Pythagoras never laughed.4
 That he infallibly predicted earthquakes, storms, and plagues. That he said that earthquakes are conventions of the dead.5 Also, that “there was such persuasion and charm in his words that every day almost the entire city turned to him, as to a god present among them, and all men ran in crowds to hear him.”6 And, that when he and his associates once crossed the river Nessus, Pythagoras spoke to the river, and it loudly replied: “Hail,

One ancient poem says that Pythagoras was the son of the god Apollo, who visited his mother: “Pythagoras, whom Pythias bore for Apollo, dear to Zeus, she who was the loveliest of the Samians.”8

Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted in important affairs.”9



 But was he even a mathematician? His admirers linked numbers and religion. Did their religious beliefs affect our views on mathematics?

Note: 11



In this follow-up to his popular Science Secrets, Alberto A. Martínez discusses various popular myths from the history of mathematics: that Pythagoras proved the hypotenuse theorem, that Archimedes figured out how to test the purity of a gold crown while he was in a bathtub, that the Golden Ratio is in nature and ancient architecture, that the young Galois created group theory the night before the pistol duel that killed him, and more. Some stories are partly true, others are entirely false, but all show the power of invention in history. Pythagoras emerges as a symbol of the urge to conjecture and “fill in the gaps” of history. He has been credited with fundamental discoveries in mathematics and the sciences, yet there is nearly no evidence that he really contributed anything to such fields at all. This book asks: how does history change when we subtract the many small exaggerations and interpolations that writers have added for over two thousand years?

The Cult of Pythagoras is also about invention in a positive sense. Most people view mathematical breakthroughs as “discoveries” rather than invention or creativity, believing that mathematics describes a realm of eternal ideas. But mathematicians have disagreed about what is possible and impossible, about what counts as a proof, and even about the results of certain operations. Was there ever invention in the history of concepts such as zero, negative numbers, imaginary numbers, quaternions, infinity, and infinitesimals?

Martínez inspects a wealth of primary sources, in several languages, over a span of many centuries. By exploring disagreements and ambiguities in the history of the elements of mathematics, The Cult of Pythagoras dispels myths that obscure the actual origins of mathematical concepts. Martínez argues that an accurate history that analyzes myths reveals neglected aspects of mathematics that can encourage creativity in students and mathematicians.
