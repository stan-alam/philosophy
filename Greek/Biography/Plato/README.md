I do mean “introduction”: finer points of interpretation and philosophical complexities play no part, and I have toed a fairly conservative line on most issues that exercise interpreters of Plato

This is not a book about Plato’s philosophy but about Plato,

By contrast, we have about a million words from Aristotle’s pen, and if we had his lost works, the figure would probably be nearer three million. But prolificness is not the only criterion by which to judge a writer; Plato was creative and original in everything he wrote.

Introduction

Notes: 19

In a world in which information and misinformation are more widespread than ever before, especially thanks to social media and the Internet, should we not reconsider Plato’s insistence that our actions should be based on knowledge, not belief or opinion? When many perpetuators of popular culture drag us down to the level of the lowest common denominator, let’s reflect on Plato’s reasons for loathing both trivialization and the unthinking acceptance of ideas and practices even when they are widely sanctioned by society.

us, but the “us” in that sentence consists chiefly of practicing philosophers.

In a world in which even liberal democracies can be distorted by fanatical, incompetent, and emotionally immature leaders, should we perhaps not pay more attention to Plato’s prescriptions for turning out political leaders who are both competent and principled?

Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947), who wrote in Process and Reality, published in 1929: “The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.”

Out of Plato,” Emerson said, in his chapter on Plato in Representative Men (1876), “come all things that are still written and debated among men of thought.” We note his “all things,” a measure of Plato’s great importance.

Aristotle’s debts are more close and obvious than those of, say, Judith Butler, but the foundations of even Butler’s work were laid down by Plato.

more to the point to say that he raised questions that should still provoke us—all of us, not just philosophers.

Whitehead was preceded on the other side of the Atlantic by Ralph Waldo Emerson, leader of the Transcendentalists

ut I am saying that, whether or not we know it, our minds have been affected by him. Moreover, I have suggested that he still has important lessons for us—that he should continue to affect the way we think about many of the issues that currently trouble or perplex us. This book, then, attempts to contextualize the work of this important thinker and to uncover as much as possible what else he did other than write books.

without Plato, European culture would be poorer, or at least it would have had to struggle to attain the same richness. Plato cannot be dismissed as just a dead white male. It is safe to say that, apart from the Bible, no body of written work has had such an impact on the Western world as Plato’s dialogues.

Most ancient Greek literature has been lost, sometimes by accident, but more often because it was felt to be not worth preserving, in the sense that, in the centuries before the invention of the printing press, no one was asking scribes to make copies.

Platonism has reappeared in some form or other in philosophical contexts—in much early Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought;

02.06.2023 16:42

we have the complete set of Plato’s dialogues; not a single word that he published has been lost. Every generation of readers in antiquity and the Middle Ages felt that Plato’s work was worth preserving.

The Sources

Notes: 10

347: Aristotle and Speusippus wrote poems; Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Philip of Opus wrote biographies, probably of an encomiastic nature;

Philodemus of Gadara, in the first century BCE, included a critical account of Plato’s life in the part of his massive History of the Philosophers that was dedicated to the history of the Academy.

Six ancient Lives of Plato exist in whole or part.

\-1/216

02.06.2023 16:44

What are the sources, and how reliable are they? In Plato’s case, they are peculiarly intriguing. There are three kinds of source: biographies written in antiquity, letters written in antiquity under Plato’s name, and Plato’s own published works. All three of these sources are problematic in their own distinct ways. There are also countless references to Plato by other ancient writers, but they are concerned with philosophy rather than biography.

These surviving Lives are, in chronological order: On Plato and His Teaching (second century CE), by the novelist and Platonist Apuleius of Madaurus; the third chapter of the Lives of the Eminent Philosophers (third century CE) by the biographer Diogenes Laertius; the opening sections of Commentary on Plato’s First Alcibiades (sixth century CE) by the Platonist scholar Olympiodorus the Younger; an anonymous Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy (sixth century CE); and the entry “Plato” in the Dictionary of Wise Men Distinguished in the Field of Intellectual Studies (sixth century CE), by Hesychius of Miletus.1

Preface

Notes: 3

I am aware, the last dedicated biography in English of any length was published in 1839, when B. B. Edwards translated the Life of Plato by Wilhelm Tennemann and included it in his and E. A. Park’s Selections from German Literature.

Acknowledgments

Notes: 1

The book was written under COVID-19 restrictions. It is in any case my usual practice to ask friends and colleagues to send me offprints of articles of theirs that are unavailable in the online archives, but, denied access to libraries, it was especially important this time.

List of Plato’s Dialogues

Notes: 4

even though some scarcely involve any give and take between interlocutors,

02.06.2023 08:41

We have the complete works of Plato. There is, these days, a high degree of unanimity among scholars as to which dialogues are genuine and which are not. I count twenty-eight as genuine. This is a good number of titles, but Plato was not an especially prolific writer: these twenty-eight dialogues amount to somewhat over 540,000 words,1 which is about the same as David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest.

23/216

02.06.2023 09:49

Here is an alphabetical list of the genuine dialogues, many of them named after one of the lead characters who appears in the work. Most of them feature Socrates as the main driver of the discussion. First Alcibiades Apology of Socrates (often shortened to Apology) Charmides Cratylus Critias Crito Euthydemus Euthyphro Gorgias Hippias Major Hippias Minor Ion Laches Laws Lysis Menexenus Meno Parmenides Phaedo Phaedrus Philebus Protagoras Republic (the first chapter of Republic probably started life as a separate short dialogue called Thrasymachus) Sophist Statesman (or Politicus) Symposium Theaetetus Timaeus

Apology of Socrates, is an alleged transcript of the defense speeches Socrates, Plato’s teacher, gave at his trial in 399 BCE

Introduction

Notes: 3

Academy, which was dedicated not just to philosophy, but to scientific research and practical politics, and fostered thinkers of the stature of Aristotle and Eudoxus, whose multiple influences on subsequent thinkers were profound. The Academy taught philosophy and encouraged research for almost a thousand years, a span still unsurpassed by any other educational establishment in the West.
