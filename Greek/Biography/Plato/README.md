## Plato of Athens

Early Christian writers, who found much of Plato’s work compatible with their own beliefs, interpreted this as parthenogenesis.

The only fixed date that we have for Plato’s life, confirmed by historians, is that he died in the year 348/7. 

The most important is that there is no evidence that he fought in any of the last battles of the Peloponnesian War in 406 and 405, so he was probably still under the age of twenty. Athens was critically short of manpower at the time, so he would certainly have been called up. Young Athenian men did a form of military service when they were eighteen and nineteen, but within the borders of Attica (the countryside of which Athens was the urban center); they did not serve abroad until they were twenty. So Plato seems to have still been under twenty in 405.

415, at the instigation of the ambitious aristocrat

Alcibiades and his political allies, who played the populist card, they chose to invade the island of Sicily, where the most powerful city was Syracuse, a potential ally of Sparta.


It was utterly unrealistic to expect to be able to rule as troubled and as large an island as Sicily from distant Athens. Two years later, the Athenian expeditionary force was wiped out with the loss, over the course of the expedition, of forty thousand men—Athenians, allies, and mercenary auxiliaries.

In 411 an oligarchy seized control of the government and delegated executive power to a council of four hundred sympathizers drawn from the ranks of the disgruntled rich. The transition was relatively peaceful, but after only a few months the people rose up against the council, which had signally failed to keep any of its promises, and democracy was

 restored. Plato was old enough to pay critical attention to the turmoil; his family belonged to the same stratum of society as the oligarchs, and at least some of them may have had some sympathy for the cause.


renewed hope between 411 and 408, when Alcibiades achieved significant successes at sea, but after that, hope died. The Persians, who wanted to reclaim their mastery of the Greek city-states of Asia Minor, most of which were in the Athenian alliance,

started to underwrite the Spartan war effort. This assistance made it possible for the Spartans to develop a powerful fleet, when naval superiority had been the essential underpinning of Athenian hopes 

404. The Athenian navy had been annihilated the previous year, leaving Athens vulnerable. The Spartans besieged the city into starvation and then imposed the rule of the Thirty.

He witnessed the famous Athenian democracy at its most extreme and irresponsible, with the people thinking only of their own power, not what was good for the city as a whole.

They enthusiastically voted for the invasion of wealthy Sicily; they relished Alcibiades’s victories but banished him after a single defeat. In a vote that was probably unconstitutional, and was certainly ill advised, they condemned eight of their ten elected generals to death after a sea battle in 406;

In later years Plato was never sympathetic to democracy, though toward the end of his life he came to recognize that the people must be allowed to have a say in the political life of their community; in his youth **he saw the disastrous effects of rule by people who were not political experts, and he always clung to the ideal of the truly knowledgeable political leader.**

lines, and Plato always insisted that unity and concord were crucial for political stability, and that stability was crucial for people to be able to flourish and fulfill themselves. “Could we describe anything as worse for a community,” asks Socrates in Plato’s Republic, “than what tears it apart and destroys its unity?

Athenian families, his father’s family even traced their lineage back to the god Poseidon. Plato, however, was, or came to be, dubious about such claims.9 The family’s wealth was based, as was typical of the long- established families of the Athenian elite, on their ownership of land. 

. Plato had two older brothers, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and an older sister, Potone. Adeimantus was probably born in 430 and Glaucon the following year, since both were old enough to take part in a battle outside the borders of Attica in 409. A poem addressed to them began: “Sons of Ariston, godlike offspring of an eminent sire.”10 Potone was born around 426, and then Plato in 424 or 423. Potone married a man called Eurymedon, and in or around 407 gave birth to a son, Speusippus, who would become a famous philosopher in his own right and succeed Plato 

The ancient biographers and others tell us that he was named “Plato” because he was fat or stocky (Greek platus) or perhaps “broad” in the sense of having a capacious intellect. Once they had concluded that “Plato” was a nickname,

It was a perfectly normal name.11 Besides, the common practice of naming a son after his grandfather was reserved for the eldest son. So the future philosopher’s full name was Plato, the son of Ariston, of the deme Collytus and the tribe Aegeis

All full Athenian citizens belonged to a hereditary deme and tribe. A deme was a parish—there were 139 in Attica—but a person might belong to a deme without living there. He was registered in the deme in which his ancestor had been enrolled at the time of the reform of Athenian society along democratic lines at the very end of the sixth century,

remembered as the father of Theseus (and after whom the Aegean Sea is named).
 Plato was probably born on the island of Aegina in the Saronic Gulf, southwest of Athens. The island was taken over by the Athenians in 431, the first year of the Peloponnesian War. They expelled the islanders, who, out of long hostility toward Athens, were on good terms with the Spartans, Athens’s enemies, and they resettled the island with their own citizens, including Ariston.

Under Athenian law women could not own property, and all of Perictione’s sons were still underage, so she was married off to her uncle Pyrilampes. This was not considered incestuous;

perfectly normal way of ensuring that the estate stayed in the family. So Plato never knew his natural father, and Pyrilampes was to all intents and purposes his father.

It was while Pyrilampes was on one such mission for Athens that he acquired his famous peacocks; they were not the first that had ever been seen in Athens—earlier ambassadors to the east had also received them as gifts—but they were still delightfully exotic. 

**Perictione had a son called Antiphon, born around 421**. We know virtually nothing of the activities of this half-brother. Plato makes him the narrator of his dialogue Parmenides, which presumably indicates an interest in philosophy, but nothing seems to have come of it, and in later life he was more interested in horse breeding than abstract thinking—and some of Parmenides is highly abstract.


**Glaucon** certainly, and Adeimantus probably, had political ambitions, but neither of them became prominent.

Glaucon also features in conversation with Socrates in one of the Socratic works written by Plato’s contemporary, Xenophon, and was credited with writing dialogues featuring Socrates. Whether genuine or not, none of these dialogues has survived. Adeimantus was close enough to Socrates to be among the onlookers at his trial in 399, along with Plato. 

He was a well-known author of poems and plays and an admirer of the Spartan constitution and way of life, which he praised in a couple of works.14 In terms of the main polarity of ancient Greek politics in the Classical period, oligarchy versus democracy, he was an oligarch,

in history was assured when he became one of the leaders, and probably the ideologue, of the Thirty Tyrants. **Pyrilampes, however, was a democrat. In wartime years, it is easy for politics to divide a family.**


Thirty set up a board of ten men to administer Piraeus, the port of Athens, and Charmides was one of the ten. Along with Critias, he had been suspected of involvement in an abortive 

oligarchic coup in 415, and after that episode he fled the city and was condemned to death in absentia. I have suggested that the main trigger for the oligarchic revolution of 411 was that the rich were being reduced to relative poverty, and we know that Charmides had suffered in this way.15 He was still in exile in 411, otherwise it seems likely that he would have been involved in the oligarchic coup that took place then.


Athenian upper-class men did not usually marry for love but rather for the political and commercial connections their wives could bring to the family.

Ironically, however, in the city-state he imagined in Laws, he would make it compulsory for a man to marry between the ages of thirty and thirty-five.
 


 We have no direct evidence for Plato’s early education, but it would have conformed to Greek norms. Education was designed above all to socialize children—to indoctrinate them into the values of their society. It is not surprising, then, that Plato was in many ways a man of his times. In real life he kept slaves—five house slaves are mentioned in his will, and each of his farms would have been worked and run by a half dozen or so slaves, as all farms of any size were—and 

imaginary societies of Callipolis and Magnesia (those, respectively, of Republic and Laws) both have institutional chattel slavery, but the punishments that Plato imagined for wrongdoing by slaves in Magnesia were harsher than those that existed under Athenian law.

Note: Harsh punishment

Magnesia women are full citizens alongside men, in reality he seems to have thought women 
Note: 2

inferior to men. He held that if men undertook the activities that were traditionally reserved for women, they would prove to be better at them; that men are more intelligent than women; that plundering the corpses on a battlefield is the mark of a womanish mind;

that a cowardly man would be reborn in his next incarnation as a woman; that women are more secretive and devious than men. Even in Laws women seem to be debarred from higher political offices. To put it at its harshest: Plato was less interested in women as women than he was in their potential to be men.


home were taught in a sporadic fashion, for a few weeks or a few years, by three kinds of teacher. A **grammatistēs taught them reading, writing, and arithmetic, and made them study and even learn and recite substantial chunks of epic poetry, since Homer,** especially, was regarded as a fount of wisdom in many areas (see figure 1.3). Plato would later criticize the expectation that by studying poetry people would be provided with role models to emulate; in his view, expressed especially in Republic, the gods and other characters described by Homer and others were often too corrupt to act as exemplars.
Note: Plato does not like folks rote memorizing homer to only quote the bard.

The other two schools were more specialized and more for **elite children**. **A kitharistēs** taught music, singing, dancing, and the lyric poets, 

paidotribēs supervised their physical education at a gymnasium (likely to be publicly owned) or “palaestra” (“wrestling-ground,” likely to be privately owned), to prepare them for all forms of athletic contest and for warfare. 

 biographies appear to know the names of Plato’s teachers: a certain Dionysius was his grammatistēs,19 Dracon of Athens and Metellus of Acragas were his kitharistai, and Ariston of Argos was his paidotribē

Plato sketched this aspect of a child’s education in Protagoras:21
Note: Protagoras sophist

To Plato’s mind, however, this was a hit-or-miss system: the eminent Athenian statesmen Themistocles and Pericles were good men (let’s suppose) and brought their sons up right, but the sons still turned out to be unexceptional.22 Why? Is excellence (virtue, aretē) not teachable? This question may even have been the spur that made Plato a philosopher. It is prominent in Meno and Protagoras and puts in an occasional appearance elsewhere.

gave him some notion of critical thinking, since the dramas, though set in the legendary past, invariably raised social and political issues that were relevant to contemporary Athens. Tragic poets were considered “the teachers of Greece.”23 Plato was growing up at a time when the tragedian Euripides, the most philosophical of the playwrights, was at the height of his popularity.
Note: Europides

However, Plato would later criticize drama as a form of rhetoric that could make people believe certain things but could not impart knowledge.

Plato is said to have studied painting, but that does not seem likely: it was not generally an upper-class pursuit. At least two of the writers who perpetuate this information point to a passage of Timaeus as evidence that Plato knew about

But the story that he destroyed his early tragedies after his “conversion” to philosophy25 is such a cliché that we might be inclined to dismiss the whole set of tales as false, were it not for their plausibility. As a well-educated young man with literary aspirations, and also as a participant in symposia, it is very likely that he tried his hand at poetry. “I’ve had a kind of fascinated admiration for Homer ever since I was young,

 has Socrates say in Republic, surely speaking for himself.26 And Plato certainly had a sense of the tragic; no one who reads the sequence of dialogues surrounding Socrates’s trial and death (Apology of Socrates, Crito, Phaedo) can have any doubt about that.


Perhaps Plato felt that he was just too sane and rational to make a great poet.
 

 shall not bring shame upon my sacred weapons, nor shall I desert the man beside me, wherever I stand in the line. I shall fight in defense of things sacred and secular, and I shall not hand on the fatherland lessened, but greater and better as far as I am able and together with all. And I shall be obedient to those who exercise power reasonably at any time, and to the laws currently in force and any reasonably put into force in the future. If anyone destroys these, I shall not give him allegiance as far as is in my power and together with all. And I shall honor the ancestral religion.


his life, he never had to work to make money but lived off the labor of those who worked his estates. He was even said to have been the first not to charge for his teaching, though that distinction properly belongs to Socrates.

This extremely costly liturgy was undertaken on one occasion by Pyrilampes’s son Demos, which gives some idea of the wealth that Pyrilampes brought to Plato’s family when he married Perictione. The most expensive festival liturgy was the chorēgia, which involved recruiting a chorus for a dramatic or choral festival and paying for the trainers, the training, the rehearsals, the costumes, the scenery, and the equipment. This was the liturgy that Plato was called on to perform; 

The state assumed that Plato had at least several hundred drachmas to spare, and by complying with the order, Plato agreed. He was among the two thousand or so most wealthy men in Athens, truly a member of the top 1 percent. Even if we believe the story that Plato’s liturgical expenses were covered by someone else,

The bulk of his wealth seems to have come from two large farms in the countryside north and east of Athens, one inherited from his family and one that he bought himself.

translated such pride into snobbery. In a brilliant stretch of Republic,37 he first bemoans the fact that the kind of people who should take up philosophy are seduced away from it by the lure of worldly power and then vilifies the unsuitable people who, attracted by the prestige of philosophy, claim the field for themselves. He concludes with this savage little portrait:

impression these interlopers give is any different from that of a small, bald metalworker who’s come into some money? He’s just got himself out of debtors’ prison, he’s had a bath and is wearing brand-new clothes and a bridegroom’s outfit, and he’s about to marry his master’s daughter because she’s hard up and has no one to look after her.

By the same token, people from the working class in the fictional city-state of Republic are rigidly excluded from a share in government, on the grounds that their occupation makes it impossible for them to have the kind of lofty and

long-term thoughts that are appropriate to political leaders. Plato mellowed somewhat in his later years, but, under the influence in the first instance of his childhood upbringing, he shared not just his class’s pride in their wealth and education but also their snobbery about those who had to work for a living. In this sense, too, he was a man of his times.

Since he believed that the gods were only ever good, he came to reject stories of their lying, cheating, vindictiveness, and so on. “We’d better not admit into our city the story of 

Greek religion was based on practice rather than belief. There was no sacred text to whose provisions one had to adhere, no commandments or creed in which one had to believe in order to be “orthodox,” no Church to coordinate practice and develop doctrine. Religion was largely a matter of the appropriate performance of ritual. But ritual also rested 

on a bedrock of beliefs: that the gods exist, that they provide for us, that they know more and are more powerful than us, and that they can be moved by sacrifice and prayer.

petition them, it should not be for worldly prosperity, but only be for help in what is, essentially, one’s own doing. We have an example:39

Zeus and his extended Olympian family—but also of God in the singular. A few other thinkers before and during his lifetime did the same; the lineage began with Xenophanes of Colophon in the sixth/fifth century and included another follower of Socrates called Antisthenes. Plato was partaking in and giving impetus to a movement that would culminate only a few decades after his death in the monotheism

the Stoics, who saw the traditional gods more as the Semitic religions today see angels—as agents of God’s providence for the world. Plato sets off in that direction, especially in the astral theology he outlines in late dialogues such as Timaeus and Laws, where the heavenly bodies are gods that—in an almost astrological fashion—intermediate between God and humankind.


their human nature, not in transcending it. But Plato believed that human nature has a divine as well as a bestial aspect—that we are attracted to what is true as well as to what is pleasant—and that it is our purpose to develop the divine in us, to become godlike ourselves.

He acknowledges, however, that there are few who will be interested in undertaking the hard, private work involved in such a path; for most people, religion will remain the public worship of the Olympian deities through festivals and sacrifices. But God is the paradigm of goodness and moral perfection, and this will inspire at least

few people to aim to be as like him as is possible for incarnate beings. Our souls are immortal, and the point of philosophy is to purify the soul until it is capable of achieving communion with God and breaking free of the constant cycle of reincarnations. Anyone who manages to be a philosopher in three successive incarnations will never have to be incarnated again.

Plato’s mature thoughts about God and religion represent some of his most sincerely held views. Plato’s God is a rational being, who guides the universe for the good of his creatures, especially human beings, and has left clues that this is what he does—clues that are visible to those with eyes to see. But despite being, as it were, Reason personified, Plato’s God is capable of arousing the kind of emotional response that

constitutes religious feeling, just because he does us nothing but good. Anything bad in our lives is our own fault, not God’s. God is “the best kind of soul, that takes care of the universe as a whole and guides it along its path.”

though traditional, were not mainstream. His talk of assimilation to God as the goal of life echoes an ecstatic and salvationist thread in Greek religion, in which one transcends the material world by purging oneself of impurities and becomes, in effect, a god oneself.

Plato this state is achieved not by practices such as drug taking or trance-dance (famously practiced in Plato’s day by the Corybantes of Asia Minor), but by rational inquiry. He agrees that it takes a kind of “god-given madness” to transcend the material world and glimpse the “Plain of Truth,”44 but the work of trying to turn that glimpse into a permanent awareness is largely rational work.


Republic, he has Socrates attending a festival in Piraeus. But at the same time, he was also urging himself and others not to carelessly accept conventional beliefs (this is a recurrent theme in his work) but to go farther and deeper, and even to attempt to bridge the gulf between humanity and immortality.

It is “proximity [to transcendent Forms] that gives a god his divine qualities,”45 and Plato constantly holds out the promise that a true philosopher can also get to know and contemplate the Plain of Truth, where the Forms subsist.

This is not a literal place but Plato’s way of expressing the idea that there is more to the world than our five senses can detect.

**Aristoxenus of Taras: Plato was physically repulsive, morally corrupt, and intellectually dishonest.**

**He was a pederast, a whoremonger, and a slave to tyrants, despite being hungry for political power.** None of his work is original; all is taken from other thinkers. There is no way of proving Aristoxenus wrong, but surely his vehemence betrays him.

Epicharmus of Cos; Plato was not allowed to attend meetings of Pythagorean groups in case he stole the ideas; he got the notion of writing his works as dialogues from Sophron the writer of mimes, whose skill at characterization he also imitated; he copied the work of his fellow Socratics Antisthenes and Aristippus and, more inexplicably, that of the mathematician Bryson of Heraclea.

before Socrates. What unites them is the attempt to give a systematic account of the whole known universe and all its major features, from the setting of the stars to the rising of the Nile. In fact, despite the name, the kind of scientific work they were doing continued during and well past Socrates’s lifetime. Among the Presocratics, Plato mentions by name Thales of Miletus, Heraclitus of Ephesus, Parmenides and Zeno of Elea, Empedocles of Acragas, Pythagoras of Samos (and the Pythagoreans), and Anaxagoras of Clazomenae. This is a fairly complete roll call of the leading lights,

Presocratic doctrines without naming names. However, his failure to mention by name Democritus of Abdera, a very important thinker and prolific writer who was still working and writing in his lifetime, is a perennial puzzle, first mentioned by Diogenes Laertius. It is clear that Plato had read widely in the Presocratic treatises, and he was presumably also acquainted with the summary of the Presocratics’ and others’ theories prepared by the polymath Hippias of Elis toward the end of the fifth century.
Note: 5

What Plato chiefly took from the Presocratics was the basic principle that the world is not the playground of capricious gods but an ordered system that is comprehensible by the human mind and which therefore can be laid bare by reason and argument, rather than by the senses and faith. Otherwise, he is generally critical of their scientific work.

. Anaximenes of Miletus, for instance, made air his primary cosmic substance and claimed that everything else was the result of the thickening or thinning of air. Plato calls this kind of notion childish and even atheistic;3 in his view it is not the case that the only things that exist are bodies and their properties. In Phaedo, Plato gives Socrates a kind of intellectual autobiography, which might as well be his as Socrates’s. He says that Socrates was excited by the work of Anaxagoras, who claimed that Mind was the creative and driving force of the cosmos, but found that he failed to follow up this insight and, like Anaximenes and others, relied on purely material and mechanical causes.4 In Timaeus, the

 By the third quarter of the fifth century, a new breed of professional teachers began to arrive in Athens to provide a kind of higher education. Many of the sophists (as they came to be called, though, like “Presocratics,” the generic label obscures specific differences) were itinerant teachers,
**Note: Protogorous...man is measure of all things**

 subjects—from mathematics to martial arts, and from history to music—with particular topics more popular in particular places. Much of their teaching was less theoretical than practical. This is the most important way in which their contemporary, Socrates, differed from the sophists: if Plato is to be trusted, Socrates had an interest in ethical and metaphysical theory as well as developing an effective method of argument and enquiry. Socrates also was not a professional; he took no money for his teaching because he felt that the most important things he had to pass on were encouragement and inspiration, not information or the key to worldly success.
Note: 02

The kind of success the sophists were claiming to teach was importantly different from the kind that had been valued before, which was based on charisma—on the aristocratic values of military prowess, eloquence, athleticism, benefaction, and good looks.

Possession of this cluster of qualities gave a man aretē, excellence; under the influence of the sophists, the meaning of the word shifted to mean political and moral excellence—kinds of excellence that did not depend on blood or breeding but had to be earned and worked for. The sophists did not initiate this revolution, but they were foremost in perpetuating

The sophists latched onto and made extensive analytical use of the opposition between nature (physis) and convention (nomos—the same word means both official “law” and unofficial “custom”).

the stronger state or individual will rule the weaker, or should the strong restrain themselves and deny their self-interest in accordance with conventional justice? But does this not make human law a kind of tyrant? And so on. Plato discusses and problematizes many of these issues in his dialogues, and the nature/convention distinction underlies many of his arguments.
Note: 4

Prodicus of Ceos is in a nearby room with his admirers. Apart from these three, other sophists appear or are mentioned in the dialogues: Gorgias of Leontini, Polus of Acragas, Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, Evenus of Paros, Damon of Oa, and the brothers Euthydemus and Dionysodorus of Chios.

Note: 5

excitement that the sophists aroused was offset by a degree of suspicion, especially among those with conservative values. “Any decent Athenian gentleman,” claims Anytus in Plato’s Meno, “will do a better job of improving a young man than the sophists.”11 They were feared as slick—as deinos, a word that simultaneously meant “clever” and “frightening.

In itself, Diopeithes’s decree was aimed at Presocratic scientists rather than sophists, and was perhaps a way to get at Pericles, the leading Athenian statesman of the time, who counted Anaxagoras among his close friends. But the case seems not to have come to court, and Anaxagoras simply left Athens to avoid trouble.

On the other hand, it is certain that another of Pericles’s associates (a kinsman by marriage), the Athenian musicologist and political theorist Damon, was banished “for seeming to be too much of an intellectual.”15 And Diagoras of Melos, a poet of otherwise little consequence, fled into exile to avoid a trial for atheism.

Intellectuals got into trouble only on those extremely rare occasions when they were felt to be politically undesirable or (what came to the same thing) to be in danger of offending the gods. The legal instruments that were available to be used against them were either Diopeithes’s decree or the more flexible charge of impiety—the charge that would be brought against Plato’s teacher, Socrates.

 Plato and Socrates
 In Plato’s opinion, Socrates was “the best, the wisest, and the most just” person of his time,17 and he is said to have thanked his lucky stars that he was born in his time.18 I have suggested that Plato was introduced to him by his brothers; in fact, among the ancient 

Apuleius of Madaurus says that it was his father, Ariston, who effected the introduction, since he was planning to hire Socrates as Plato’s tutor. But Ariston was long dead. Perhaps Apuleius meant to name Pyrilampes, Plato’s stepfather; but, still, it was in Rome and the provincial cities of the Roman empire in Apuleius’s day that rich men hired famous philosophers as private tutors for their sons, not in fifth-century Athens.

 was famous enough by the time of Plato’s birth to have been one of the butts of Aristophanes’s satirical play Clouds, produced in 423. Although Socrates was not from the same social stratum as Plato’s family, he had married well and was a familiar figure in some quarters of Athenian high society.

They reflect the fact that it was important to both of them—to Socrates because now he had someone to carry on his work and to Plato because he had found his teacher. But most of the stories they tell either focus on Plato’s conversion to philosophy by Socrates, who persuaded him in one anecdote not to go and become a professional mercenary soldier,19 or stem from the tradition hostile to Plato and imply that Plato misrepresented Socrates’s teachings.

Plato’s Laches, for instance, we should not think that Socrates ever engaged the two Athenian generals, Laches and Nicias, on the topic of courage; he might have, but even so, Plato could not have been present at the conversation and no one recorded it. The conversation is Plato’s idea of what might have taken place had such a meeting ever occurred.

**Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero said that he “was the first to call philosophy down from the heavens, transfer it to society and even introduce it into people’s homes, and compel it to inquire about life and morality—about what things are good and bad.”21**

### Actually, since the earliest sophists predate Socrates, it was they who first “called philosophy down from the heavens” (that is, broke away from Presocratic proto-scientific cosmology) and focused on politics and human ethics. Socrates, from this perspective, was part of a movement

followed by the sophists and by the Presocratic thinker Democritus of Abdera; but it is probably safe to say that he was the most important element in that movement.
 Aristotle’s summary of Socrates’s work is also useful:22 “Although he confined his inquiry to ethics and did not study the nature of the universe as a whole, he still sought within the moral sphere for the universal and was the first to concentrate his attention on definitions.” This is very much what we find Socrates doing in one set of Plato’s dialogues, and to a lesser extent in Xenophon’s accounts of Socrates as well. In Laches, for example, the issue is to define courage.
Note: 04

It is thanks to Socrates that philosophy became and remains inquisitive and self-reflective, whereas before his time it had been dogmatic. For Socrates, and then for Plato, philosophy was argument, **not the production of untested and untestable grand ideas.**

Reason assures a seeker that the Forms exist, and then he might be able to sense their existence as well. Diogenes the Cynic once cast doubt on the existence of Forms: “I can see a table and a cup, but not tablehood and cuphood.” Plato replied: “That’s right, because you have the eyes with which to see a cup and a table, but not the mind with which to comprehend tablehood and cuphood.”23

Thrasymachus,

Socrates confronts sophists: Hippias Major, Hippias Minor, Euthydemus, Protagoras, and Gorgias.
 Another factor is the opening of Timaeus.

The dialogue begins with what it claims is a summary of Republic (because the conversation of Timaeus is supposed to be taking place the day after the conversation of Republic), but it omits a great deal of Republic as we have it and the discussants are not those of Republic as we have it. Could it be a description of the proto-Republic? Yet another factor is that the Roman writer Aulus Gellius says that Xenophon wrote his The Education of Cyrus

Republic that was short enough to occupy only two papyrus rolls;31 at about ninety thousand words, the work as we have it would occupy three rolls. But on what authority does Gellius say this? He was writing in the second century ce, five hundred years later than Plato.

Third, there may be passages in some dialogues that are incomprehensible or make little sense without taking into account something from another dialogue, which is therefore earlier. Fourth, if we find a passage where a valid insight from another dialogue would have enabled Plato to clarify some point or other, we can assume that the dialogue without the insight is earlier than the one with

Note: Important

There are two dominant approaches to interpreting Plato’s works: unitarianism and developmentalism. My tent is pitched in the latter camp. Unitarians come in various forms but essentially believe that Plato never changed his mind; he had worked out his total philosophy, at least in its broad outlines, before he started writing, and the dialogues are simply successive elaborations of aspects of this philosophy. Plato’s writing career spanned about fifty years, and the idea that his thought underwent no development seems implausible.
Note: Two dominant approaches to Plato... Unitarian.... Develop...

However, there is one respect in which unitarianism is correct. There are certain basic principles—together they make up what has been called Ur-Platonism—that underlie all of Plato’s metaphysical and epistemological work.

First, he was always opposed to materialism, the doctrine that only bodies exist, and equally opposed to the kind of mechanistic explanations on which materialists rely. In a famous passage, Plato has Socrates pour scorn on the idea that the fact that he is sitting in prison is better explained

Most ancient Greek literature has been lost, sometimes by accident, but more often because it was felt to be not worth preserving, in the sense that, in the centuries before the invention of the printing press, no one was asking scribes to make copies. Yet we have the complete set of Plato’s dialogues; not a single word that he published has been lost. Every generation of readers in antiquity and the Middle Ages felt that Plato’s work was worth preserving. In short, without Plato, European culture would be poorer, or at least it would have had to struggle to attain the same richness. Plato cannot be dismissed as just a dead white male. It is safe to say that, apart from the Bible, no body of written work has had such an impact on the Western world as Plato’s dialogues. Over the centuries, Platonism has reappeared in some form or other in philosophical contexts—in much early Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought; in the ideas of the Cambridge Platonists such as Henry More and Ralph Cudworth; in the slightly later seventeenth-century dispute between John Locke and Gottfried Leibniz; even in the late nineteenth-century “platonism” of Gottlob Frege’s mathematical philosophy. But that is not my point, which is that Plato bears some responsibility for forming and tuning the way all of us think, whatever our gender, skin color, cultural background, or philosophical or political affiliation. In saying this, I am not promoting the chauvinistic notion that the only discipline worthy of the name “philosophy” is the Western version, founded by Plato; but I am saying that, whether or not we know it, our minds have been affected by him. Moreover, I have suggested that he still has important lessons for us—that he should continue to affect the way we think about many of the issues that currently trouble or perplex us. This book, then, attempts to contextualize the work of this important thinker and to uncover as much as possible what else he did other than

nd indeed, the authenticity of any of Plato’s letters is one of the most hotly contested issues in Platonic scholarship. It is one of those issues that is subject to scholarly fashion. At the moment the scholarly consensus, while falling well short of unanimity, is that even the most plausible of them are forgeries, but in the middle of the twentieth century the consensus was the other way around, and there are signs today that the pendulum is swinging back again. They are not “forgeries” in the sense that there is anything malicious about them, as though the writer were trying to blacken Plato’s name in some way. More accurately described, they are “pseudepigrapha,” or works written under an assumed name

By contrast, we have about a million words from Aristotle’s pen, and if we had his lost works, the figure would probably be nearer three million. But prolificness is not the only criterion by which to judge a writer; Plato was creative and original in everything he wrote.

We have the complete works of Plato. There is, these days, a high degree of unanimity among scholars as to which dialogues are genuine and which are not. I count twenty-eight as genuine. This is a good number of titles, but Plato was not an especially prolific writer: these twenty-eight dialogues amount to somewhat over 540,000 words,1 which is about the same as David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest.

I said just now that Plato raised questions that still provoke us, but the “us” in that sentence consists chiefly of practicing philosophers. It is more to the point to say that he raised questions that should still provoke us—all of us, not just philosophers. In a world in which even liberal democracies can be distorted by fanatical, incompetent, and emotionally immature leaders, should we perhaps not pay more attention to Plato’s prescriptions for turning out political leaders who are both competent and principled? In a world in which information and misinformation are more widespread than ever before, especially thanks to social media and the Internet, should we not reconsider Plato’s insistence that our actions should be based on knowledge, not belief or opinion?

The Sources

Notes: 15

Six ancient Lives of Plato exist in whole or part. Philodemus of Gadara, in the first century BCE, included a critical account of Plato’s life in the part of his massive History of the Philosophers that was dedicated to the history of the Academy. What remains of this text, however, is fragmentary: it exists only on carbonized papyrus rolls from Herculaneum in Italy, burned and preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE, and the delicate and highly technical work of reading the papyri is still ongoing. Moreover, what remains deals largely with the Academy; most of the details of Plato’s life are missing, and little is added in this respect to what we can gather from the other Lives, which have survived complete. These surviving Lives are, in chronological order: On Plato and His Teaching (second century CE), by the novelist and Platonist Apuleius of Madaurus; the third chapter of the Lives of the Eminent Philosophers (third century CE) by the biographer Diogenes Laertius; the opening sections of Commentary on Plato’s First Alcibiades (sixth century CE) by the Platonist scholar Olympiodorus the Younger; an anonymous Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy (sixth century CE); and the entry “Plato” in the Dictionary of Wise Men Distinguished in the Field of Intellectual Studies (sixth century CE), by Hesychius of Miletus.1

Common sense is the best tool with which to assess anecdotes, and it is not difficult to dismiss out of hand the notion that members of the Academy, Plato’s school, used to blind themselves so that they would not be distracted from philosophy, or that Plato died of shame when he was unable to answer a riddle.

Speusippus

32/216

07.06.2023 17:16

The tradition’s roots go back to the fourth century BCE because biographies, memoirs, and commemorative poems were written by some of Plato’s followers and others in the decades immediately after his death in 347: Aristotle and Speusippus wrote poems; Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Philip of Opus wrote biographies, probably of an encomiastic nature; Erastus of Scepsis and a certain Asclepiades wrote memoirs. In the next generation, Dicaearchus of Messana, Satyrus of Collatis, and Neanthes of Cyzicus wrote biographies, and Clearchus of Soli wrote an encomium, perhaps trying to counteract the effect of hostile accounts of Plato, because they too started early: Theopompus of Chios wrote a work Against the School of Plato, in which he seems to have charged Plato with writing many falsehoods and focusing on stuff that was useless; Idomeneus of Lampsacus wrote a book On the Followers of Socrates that recounted gossipy scandals; Aristoxenus of Taras’s Life of Plato, as far as we can tell from the few surviving fragments, drew on gossipy anecdotes and accused Plato of plagiarism and much else besides; Phaenias of Eresus must have included something about Plato in his On the Socratics; the Sicilian historian Philistus wrote a hostile account of Plato’s visits to Sicily; and comic playwrights were ridiculing Plato even during his lifetime, though not all their remarks were hostile: he is mocked above all for his obscurity, his dependence on wealthy patrons, and the uselessness of philosophy, but these were standard slurs about intellectuals.2

Letter 7 is not bland. It is written with care and a high degree of literary skill; it expresses far more of Plato’s personality and feelings than is usual in forgeries; it contains insights into Sicilian history that are not available elsewhere; and its perspective on Plato’s philosophical teachings is complex and unusual. The details of Plato’s youthful turn toward philosophy are completely plausible, as even those who doubt the letter’s authenticity agree.

To take two other fourth-century writers, the same happened with Demosthenes’s speeches and Speusippus’s letters: the corpus consists of both authentic and inauthentic works. The arguments for and against the authenticity of Plato’s letters are often highly technical, and for the purposes of this book I will not go into them to any great extent.

No forger would have dared to speak about Socrates, Plato’s teacher, as casually as the letter does. No forger would have dared to suggest that knowledge of Plato’s metaphysical teaching is not imparted by the written word—that is, by the published dialogues—but results “from long acquaintance with the matter and from being embedded in it,” when “suddenly, like a light that is kindled by a leaping spark, it is born in the soul and at once becomes self-sustaining.” And Plato adds that “there is certainly no written work of mine that covers the issues I consider important, nor will there ever be.”6
