Plato of Athens

Early Christian writers, who found much of Plato’s work compatible with their own beliefs, interpreted this as parthenogenesis.

Note: 3

The only fixed date that we have for Plato’s life, confirmed by historians, is that he died in the year 348/7. 

The most important is that there is no evidence that he fought in any of the last battles of the Peloponnesian War in 406 and 405, so he was probably still under the age of twenty. Athens was critically short of manpower at the time, so he would certainly have been called up. Young Athenian men did a form of military service when they were eighteen and nineteen, but within the borders of Attica (the countryside of which Athens was the urban center); they did not serve abroad until they were twenty. So Plato seems to have still been under twenty in 405.

415, at the instigation of the ambitious aristocrat

Alcibiades and his political allies, who played the populist card, they chose to invade the island of Sicily, where the most powerful city was Syracuse, a potential ally of Sparta.


It was utterly unrealistic to expect to be able to rule as troubled and as large an island as Sicily from distant Athens. Two years later, the Athenian expeditionary force was wiped out with the loss, over the course of the expedition, of forty thousand men—Athenians, allies, and mercenary auxiliaries.

In 411 an oligarchy seized control of the government and delegated executive power to a council of four hundred sympathizers drawn from the ranks of the disgruntled rich. The transition was relatively peaceful, but after only a few months the people rose up against the council, which had signally failed to keep any of its promises, and democracy was

 restored. Plato was old enough to pay critical attention to the turmoil; his family belonged to the same stratum of society as the oligarchs, and at least some of them may have had some sympathy for the cause.


renewed hope between 411 and 408, when Alcibiades achieved significant successes at sea, but after that, hope died. The Persians, who wanted to reclaim their mastery of the Greek city-states of Asia Minor, most of which were in the Athenian alliance,

started to underwrite the Spartan war effort. This assistance made it possible for the Spartans to develop a powerful fleet, when naval superiority had been the essential underpinning of Athenian hopes 

404. The Athenian navy had been annihilated the previous year, leaving Athens vulnerable. The Spartans besieged the city into starvation and then imposed the rule of the Thirty.

Most ancient Greek literature has been lost, sometimes by accident, but more often because it was felt to be not worth preserving, in the sense that, in the centuries before the invention of the printing press, no one was asking scribes to make copies. Yet we have the complete set of Plato’s dialogues; not a single word that he published has been lost. Every generation of readers in antiquity and the Middle Ages felt that Plato’s work was worth preserving. In short, without Plato, European culture would be poorer, or at least it would have had to struggle to attain the same richness. Plato cannot be dismissed as just a dead white male. It is safe to say that, apart from the Bible, no body of written work has had such an impact on the Western world as Plato’s dialogues. Over the centuries, Platonism has reappeared in some form or other in philosophical contexts—in much early Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought; in the ideas of the Cambridge Platonists such as Henry More and Ralph Cudworth; in the slightly later seventeenth-century dispute between John Locke and Gottfried Leibniz; even in the late nineteenth-century “platonism” of Gottlob Frege’s mathematical philosophy. But that is not my point, which is that Plato bears some responsibility for forming and tuning the way all of us think, whatever our gender, skin color, cultural background, or philosophical or political affiliation. In saying this, I am not promoting the chauvinistic notion that the only discipline worthy of the name “philosophy” is the Western version, founded by Plato; but I am saying that, whether or not we know it, our minds have been affected by him. Moreover, I have suggested that he still has important lessons for us—that he should continue to affect the way we think about many of the issues that currently trouble or perplex us. This book, then, attempts to contextualize the work of this important thinker and to uncover as much as possible what else he did other than

nd indeed, the authenticity of any of Plato’s letters is one of the most hotly contested issues in Platonic scholarship. It is one of those issues that is subject to scholarly fashion. At the moment the scholarly consensus, while falling well short of unanimity, is that even the most plausible of them are forgeries, but in the middle of the twentieth century the consensus was the other way around, and there are signs today that the pendulum is swinging back again. They are not “forgeries” in the sense that there is anything malicious about them, as though the writer were trying to blacken Plato’s name in some way. More accurately described, they are “pseudepigrapha,” or works written under an assumed name

By contrast, we have about a million words from Aristotle’s pen, and if we had his lost works, the figure would probably be nearer three million. But prolificness is not the only criterion by which to judge a writer; Plato was creative and original in everything he wrote.

Here is an alphabetical list of the genuine dialogues, many of them named after one of the lead characters who appears in the work. Most of them feature Socrates as the main driver of the discussion.

We have the complete works of Plato. There is, these days, a high degree of unanimity among scholars as to which dialogues are genuine and which are not. I count twenty-eight as genuine. This is a good number of titles, but Plato was not an especially prolific writer: these twenty-eight dialogues amount to somewhat over 540,000 words,1 which is about the same as David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest.

I said just now that Plato raised questions that still provoke us, but the “us” in that sentence consists chiefly of practicing philosophers. It is more to the point to say that he raised questions that should still provoke us—all of us, not just philosophers. In a world in which even liberal democracies can be distorted by fanatical, incompetent, and emotionally immature leaders, should we perhaps not pay more attention to Plato’s prescriptions for turning out political leaders who are both competent and principled? In a world in which information and misinformation are more widespread than ever before, especially thanks to social media and the Internet, should we not reconsider Plato’s insistence that our actions should be based on knowledge, not belief or opinion?

I could add testimonials from many others, such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), who said in his Lectures on the History of Philosophy that Plato and Aristotle “above all others deserve to be called the teachers of the human race.

Plato was not just important but super-important. And so he has been judged by some of the greatest intellects of recent times.

The Sources

Notes: 15

Six ancient Lives of Plato exist in whole or part. Philodemus of Gadara, in the first century BCE, included a critical account of Plato’s life in the part of his massive History of the Philosophers that was dedicated to the history of the Academy. What remains of this text, however, is fragmentary: it exists only on carbonized papyrus rolls from Herculaneum in Italy, burned and preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE, and the delicate and highly technical work of reading the papyri is still ongoing. Moreover, what remains deals largely with the Academy; most of the details of Plato’s life are missing, and little is added in this respect to what we can gather from the other Lives, which have survived complete. These surviving Lives are, in chronological order: On Plato and His Teaching (second century CE), by the novelist and Platonist Apuleius of Madaurus; the third chapter of the Lives of the Eminent Philosophers (third century CE) by the biographer Diogenes Laertius; the opening sections of Commentary on Plato’s First Alcibiades (sixth century CE) by the Platonist scholar Olympiodorus the Younger; an anonymous Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy (sixth century CE); and the entry “Plato” in the Dictionary of Wise Men Distinguished in the Field of Intellectual Studies (sixth century CE), by Hesychius of Miletus.1

Common sense is the best tool with which to assess anecdotes, and it is not difficult to dismiss out of hand the notion that members of the Academy, Plato’s school, used to blind themselves so that they would not be distracted from philosophy, or that Plato died of shame when he was unable to answer a riddle.

Speusippus

32/216

07.06.2023 17:16

The tradition’s roots go back to the fourth century BCE because biographies, memoirs, and commemorative poems were written by some of Plato’s followers and others in the decades immediately after his death in 347: Aristotle and Speusippus wrote poems; Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Philip of Opus wrote biographies, probably of an encomiastic nature; Erastus of Scepsis and a certain Asclepiades wrote memoirs. In the next generation, Dicaearchus of Messana, Satyrus of Collatis, and Neanthes of Cyzicus wrote biographies, and Clearchus of Soli wrote an encomium, perhaps trying to counteract the effect of hostile accounts of Plato, because they too started early: Theopompus of Chios wrote a work Against the School of Plato, in which he seems to have charged Plato with writing many falsehoods and focusing on stuff that was useless; Idomeneus of Lampsacus wrote a book On the Followers of Socrates that recounted gossipy scandals; Aristoxenus of Taras’s Life of Plato, as far as we can tell from the few surviving fragments, drew on gossipy anecdotes and accused Plato of plagiarism and much else besides; Phaenias of Eresus must have included something about Plato in his On the Socratics; the Sicilian historian Philistus wrote a hostile account of Plato’s visits to Sicily; and comic playwrights were ridiculing Plato even during his lifetime, though not all their remarks were hostile: he is mocked above all for his obscurity, his dependence on wealthy patrons, and the uselessness of philosophy, but these were standard slurs about intellectuals.2

Second, forged letters tend to be bland; the writer does not want to commit himself to saying anything that would betray the fact that he is making it up.

08.06.2023 17:18

Letter 7 is not bland. It is written with care and a high degree of literary skill; it expresses far more of Plato’s personality and feelings than is usual in forgeries; it contains insights into Sicilian history that are not available elsewhere; and its perspective on Plato’s philosophical teachings is complex and unusual. The details of Plato’s youthful turn toward philosophy are completely plausible, as even those who doubt the letter’s authenticity agree.

To take two other fourth-century writers, the same happened with Demosthenes’s speeches and Speusippus’s letters: the corpus consists of both authentic and inauthentic works. The arguments for and against the authenticity of Plato’s letters are often highly technical, and for the purposes of this book I will not go into them to any great extent.

No forger would have dared to speak about Socrates, Plato’s teacher, as casually as the letter does. No forger would have dared to suggest that knowledge of Plato’s metaphysical teaching is not imparted by the written word—that is, by the published dialogues—but results “from long acquaintance with the matter and from being embedded in it,” when “suddenly, like a light that is kindled by a leaping spark, it is born in the soul and at once becomes self-sustaining.” And Plato adds that “there is certainly no written work of mine that covers the issues I consider important, nor will there ever be.”6
