By contrast, we have about a million words from Aristotle’s pen, and if we had his lost works, the figure would probably be nearer three million. But prolificness is not the only criterion by which to judge a writer; Plato was creative and original in everything he wrote.

I am aware, the last dedicated biography in English of any length was published in 1839, when B. B. Edwards translated the Life of Plato by Wilhelm Tennemann and included it in his and E. A. Park’s Selections from German Literature.

he book is a kind of summation, the fruit of many years of thinking and writing about Plato (not that he has always been my exclusive focus).

The book was written under COVID-19 restrictions. It is in any case my usual practice to ask friends and colleagues to send me offprints of articles of theirs that are unavailable in the online archives, but, denied access to libraries, it was especially important this time.

List of Plato’s Dialogues

Notes: 4

Here is an alphabetical list of the genuine dialogues, many of them named after one of the lead characters who appears in the work. Most of them feature Socrates as the main driver of the discussion. First Alcibiades Apology of Socrates (often shortened to Apology) Charmides Cratylus Critias Crito Euthydemus Euthyphro Gorgias Hippias Major Hippias Minor Ion Laches Laws Lysis Menexenus Meno Parmenides Phaedo Phaedrus Philebus Protagoras Republic (the first chapter of Republic probably started life as a separate short dialogue called Thrasymachus) Sophist Statesman (or Politicus) Symposium Theaetetus Timaeus

We have the complete works of Plato. There is, these days, a high degree of unanimity among scholars as to which dialogues are genuine and which are not. I count twenty-eight as genuine. This is a good number of titles, but Plato was not an especially prolific writer: these twenty-eight dialogues amount to somewhat over 540,000 words,1 which is about the same as David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest.

Academy, which was dedicated not just to philosophy, but to scientific research and practical politics, and fostered thinkers of the stature of Aristotle and Eudoxus, whose multiple influences on subsequent thinkers were profound. The Academy taught philosophy and encouraged research for almost a thousand years, a span still unsurpassed by any other educational establishment in the West.

I said just now that Plato raised questions that still provoke us, but the “us” in that sentence consists chiefly of practicing philosophers. It is more to the point to say that he raised questions that should still provoke us—all of us, not just philosophers. In a world in which even liberal democracies can be distorted by fanatical, incompetent, and emotionally immature leaders, should we perhaps not pay more attention to Plato’s prescriptions for turning out political leaders who are both competent and principled? In a world in which information and misinformation are more widespread than ever before, especially thanks to social media and the Internet, should we not reconsider Plato’s insistence that our actions should be based on knowledge, not belief or opinion?

I could add testimonials from many others, such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), who said in his Lectures on the History of Philosophy that Plato and Aristotle “above all others deserve to be called the teachers of the human race.

Most ancient Greek literature has been lost, sometimes by accident, but more often because it was felt to be not worth preserving, in the sense that, in the centuries before the invention of the printing press, no one was asking scribes to make copies. Yet we have the complete set of Plato’s dialogues; not a single word that he published has been lost. Every generation of readers in antiquity and the Middle Ages felt that Plato’s work was worth preserving. In short, without Plato, European culture would be poorer, or at least it would have had to struggle to attain the same richness. Plato cannot be dismissed as just a dead white male. It is safe to say that, apart from the Bible, no body of written work has had such an impact on the Western world as Plato’s dialogues. Over the centuries, Platonism has reappeared in some form or other in philosophical contexts—in much early Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought; in the ideas of the Cambridge Platonists such as Henry More and Ralph Cudworth; in the slightly later seventeenth-century dispute between John Locke and Gottfried Leibniz; even in the late nineteenth-century “platonism” of Gottlob Frege’s mathematical philosophy. But that is not my point, which is that Plato bears some responsibility for forming and tuning the way all of us think, whatever our gender, skin color, cultural background, or philosophical or political affiliation. In saying this, I am not promoting the chauvinistic notion that the only discipline worthy of the name “philosophy” is the Western version, founded by Plato; but I am saying that, whether or not we know it, our minds have been affected by him. Moreover, I have suggested that he still has important lessons for us—that he should continue to affect the way we think about many of the issues that currently trouble or perplex us. This book, then, attempts to contextualize the work of this important thinker and to uncover as much as possible what else he did other than

He is read and studied in, I dare say, every country in the world. The indexes of a good proportion of the nonfiction books on any reader’s shelf will have an entry for Plato. Plato was not just important but super-important. And so he has been judged by some of the greatest intellects of recent times.

The Sources

Notes: 9

Six ancient Lives of Plato exist in whole or part. Philodemus of Gadara, in the first century BCE, included a critical account of Plato’s life in the part of his massive History of the Philosophers that was dedicated to the history of the Academy. What remains of this text, however, is fragmentary: it exists only on carbonized papyrus rolls from Herculaneum in Italy, burned and preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE, and the delicate and highly technical work of reading the papyri is still ongoing. Moreover, what remains deals largely with the Academy; most of the details of Plato’s life are missing, and little is added in this respect to what we can gather from the other Lives, which have survived complete. These surviving Lives are, in chronological order: On Plato and His Teaching (second century CE), by the novelist and Platonist Apuleius of Madaurus; the third chapter of the Lives of the Eminent Philosophers (third century CE) by the biographer Diogenes Laertius; the opening sections of Commentary on Plato’s First Alcibiades (sixth century CE) by the Platonist scholar Olympiodorus the Younger; an anonymous Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy (sixth century CE); and the entry “Plato” in the Dictionary of Wise Men Distinguished in the Field of Intellectual Studies (sixth century CE), by Hesychius of Miletus.1

The tradition’s roots go back to the fourth century BCE because biographies, memoirs, and commemorative poems were written by some of Plato’s followers and others in the decades immediately after his death in 347: Aristotle and Speusippus wrote poems; Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Philip of Opus wrote biographies, probably of an encomiastic nature; Erastus of Scepsis and a certain Asclepiades wrote memoirs. In the next generation, Dicaearchus of Messana, Satyrus of Collatis, and Neanthes of Cyzicus wrote biographies, and Clearchus of Soli wrote an encomium, perhaps trying to counteract the effect of hostile accounts of Plato, because they too started early: Theopompus of Chios wrote a work Against the School of Plato, in which he seems to have charged Plato with writing many falsehoods and focusing on stuff that was useless; Idomeneus of Lampsacus wrote a book On the Followers of Socrates that recounted gossipy scandals; Aristoxenus of Taras’s Life of Plato, as far as we can tell from the few surviving fragments, drew on gossipy anecdotes and accused Plato of plagiarism and much else besides; Phaenias of Eresus must have included something about Plato in his On the Socratics; the Sicilian historian Philistus wrote a hostile account of Plato’s visits to Sicily; and comic playwrights were ridiculing Plato even during his lifetime, though not all their remarks were hostile: he is mocked above all for his obscurity, his dependence on wealthy patrons, and the uselessness of philosophy, but these were standard slurs about intellectuals.2

Common sense is the best tool with which to assess anecdotes, and it is not difficult to dismiss out of hand the notion that members of the Academy, Plato’s school, used to blind themselves so that they would not be distracted from philosophy, or that Plato died of shame when he was unable to answer a riddle.

nd indeed, the authenticity of any of Plato’s letters is one of the most hotly contested issues in Platonic scholarship. It is one of those issues that is subject to scholarly fashion. At the moment the scholarly consensus, while falling well short of unanimity, is that even the most plausible of them are forgeries, but in the middle of the twentieth century the consensus was the other way around, and there are signs today that the pendulum is swinging back again. They are not “forgeries” in the sense that there is anything malicious about them, as though the writer were trying to blacken Plato’s name in some way. More accurately described, they are “pseudepigrapha,” or works written under an assumed name
