## Plato of Athens

Early Christian writers, who found much of Plato’s work compatible with their own beliefs, interpreted this as parthenogenesis.

The only fixed date that we have for Plato’s life, confirmed by historians, is that he died in the year 348/7. 

The most important is that there is no evidence that he fought in any of the last battles of the Peloponnesian War in 406 and 405, so he was probably still under the age of twenty. Athens was critically short of manpower at the time, so he would certainly have been called up. Young Athenian men did a form of military service when they were eighteen and nineteen, but within the borders of Attica (the countryside of which Athens was the urban center); they did not serve abroad until they were twenty. So Plato seems to have still been under twenty in 405.

415, at the instigation of the ambitious aristocrat

Alcibiades and his political allies, who played the populist card, they chose to invade the island of Sicily, where the most powerful city was Syracuse, a potential ally of Sparta.


It was utterly unrealistic to expect to be able to rule as troubled and as large an island as Sicily from distant Athens. Two years later, the Athenian expeditionary force was wiped out with the loss, over the course of the expedition, of forty thousand men—Athenians, allies, and mercenary auxiliaries.

In 411 an oligarchy seized control of the government and delegated executive power to a council of four hundred sympathizers drawn from the ranks of the disgruntled rich. The transition was relatively peaceful, but after only a few months the people rose up against the council, which had signally failed to keep any of its promises, and democracy was

 restored. Plato was old enough to pay critical attention to the turmoil; his family belonged to the same stratum of society as the oligarchs, and at least some of them may have had some sympathy for the cause.


renewed hope between 411 and 408, when Alcibiades achieved significant successes at sea, but after that, hope died. The Persians, who wanted to reclaim their mastery of the Greek city-states of Asia Minor, most of which were in the Athenian alliance,

started to underwrite the Spartan war effort. This assistance made it possible for the Spartans to develop a powerful fleet, when naval superiority had been the essential underpinning of Athenian hopes 

404. The Athenian navy had been annihilated the previous year, leaving Athens vulnerable. The Spartans besieged the city into starvation and then imposed the rule of the Thirty.

He witnessed the famous Athenian democracy at its most extreme and irresponsible, with the people thinking only of their own power, not what was good for the city as a whole.

They enthusiastically voted for the invasion of wealthy Sicily; they relished Alcibiades’s victories but banished him after a single defeat. In a vote that was probably unconstitutional, and was certainly ill advised, they condemned eight of their ten elected generals to death after a sea battle in 406;

In later years Plato was never sympathetic to democracy, though toward the end of his life he came to recognize that the people must be allowed to have a say in the political life of their community; in his youth **he saw the disastrous effects of rule by people who were not political experts, and he always clung to the ideal of the truly knowledgeable political leader.**

lines, and Plato always insisted that unity and concord were crucial for political stability, and that stability was crucial for people to be able to flourish and fulfill themselves. “Could we describe anything as worse for a community,” asks Socrates in Plato’s Republic, “than what tears it apart and destroys its unity?

Athenian families, his father’s family even traced their lineage back to the god Poseidon. Plato, however, was, or came to be, dubious about such claims.9 The family’s wealth was based, as was typical of the long- established families of the Athenian elite, on their ownership of land. 

. Plato had two older brothers, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and an older sister, Potone. Adeimantus was probably born in 430 and Glaucon the following year, since both were old enough to take part in a battle outside the borders of Attica in 409. A poem addressed to them began: “Sons of Ariston, godlike offspring of an eminent sire.”10 Potone was born around 426, and then Plato in 424 or 423. Potone married a man called Eurymedon, and in or around 407 gave birth to a son, Speusippus, who would become a famous philosopher in his own right and succeed Plato 

The ancient biographers and others tell us that he was named “Plato” because he was fat or stocky (Greek platus) or perhaps “broad” in the sense of having a capacious intellect. Once they had concluded that “Plato” was a nickname,

It was a perfectly normal name.11 Besides, the common practice of naming a son after his grandfather was reserved for the eldest son. So the future philosopher’s full name was Plato, the son of Ariston, of the deme Collytus and the tribe Aegeis

Note: Go see it

All full Athenian citizens belonged to a hereditary deme and tribe. A deme was a parish—there were 139 in Attica—but a person might belong to a deme without living there. He was registered in the deme in which his ancestor had been enrolled at the time of the reform of Athenian society along democratic lines at the very end of the sixth century,

. And for administrative purposes all Athenian citizens belonged to one of **ten tribes**; fellow tribesmen took part in various civic and religious rituals together, and fought side by side on the battlefield. All ten tribes were named after legendary local heroes and kings.

remembered as the father of Theseus (and after whom the Aegean Sea is named).
 Plato was probably born on the island of Aegina in the Saronic Gulf, southwest of Athens. The island was taken over by the Athenians in 431, the first year of the Peloponnesian War. They expelled the islanders, who, out of long hostility toward Athens, were on good terms with the Spartans, Athens’s enemies, and they resettled the island with their own citizens, including Ariston.

Under Athenian law women could not own property, and all of Perictione’s sons were still underage, so she was married off to her uncle Pyrilampes. This was not considered incestuous;

perfectly normal way of ensuring that the estate stayed in the family. So Plato never knew his natural father, and Pyrilampes was to all intents and purposes his father.

It was while Pyrilampes was on one such mission for Athens that he acquired his famous peacocks; they were not the first that had ever been seen in Athens—earlier ambassadors to the east had also received them as gifts—but they were still delightfully exotic. 

**Perictione had a son called Antiphon, born around 421**. We know virtually nothing of the activities of this half-brother. Plato makes him the narrator of his dialogue Parmenides, which presumably indicates an interest in philosophy, but nothing seems to have come of it, and in later life he was more interested in horse breeding than abstract thinking—and some of Parmenides is highly abstract.


**Glaucon** certainly, and Adeimantus probably, had political ambitions, but neither of them became prominent.

Glaucon also features in conversation with Socrates in one of the Socratic works written by Plato’s contemporary, Xenophon, and was credited with writing dialogues featuring Socrates. Whether genuine or not, none of these dialogues has survived. Adeimantus was close enough to Socrates to be among the onlookers at his trial in 399, along with Plato. 

He was a well-known author of poems and plays and an admirer of the Spartan constitution and way of life, which he praised in a couple of works.14 In terms of the main polarity of ancient Greek politics in the Classical period, oligarchy versus democracy, he was an oligarch,

in history was assured when he became one of the leaders, and probably the ideologue, of the Thirty Tyrants. **Pyrilampes, however, was a democrat. In wartime years, it is easy for politics to divide a family.**


Thirty set up a board of ten men to administer Piraeus, the port of Athens, and Charmides was one of the ten. Along with Critias, he had been suspected of involvement in an abortive 

oligarchic coup in 415, and after that episode he fled the city and was condemned to death in absentia. I have suggested that the main trigger for the oligarchic revolution of 411 was that the rich were being reduced to relative poverty, and we know that Charmides had suffered in this way.15 He was still in exile in 411, otherwise it seems likely that he would have been involved in the oligarchic coup that took place then.


Athenian upper-class men did not usually marry for love but rather for the political and commercial connections their wives could bring to the family.

Ironically, however, in the city-state he imagined in Laws, he would make it compulsory for a man to marry between the ages of thirty and thirty-five.
 


 We have no direct evidence for Plato’s early education, but it would have conformed to Greek norms. Education was designed above all to socialize children—to indoctrinate them into the values of their society. It is not surprising, then, that Plato was in many ways a man of his times. In real life he kept slaves—five house slaves are mentioned in his will, and each of his farms would have been worked and run by a half dozen or so slaves, as all farms of any size were—and 

imaginary societies of Callipolis and Magnesia (those, respectively, of Republic and Laws) both have institutional chattel slavery, but the punishments that Plato imagined for wrongdoing by slaves in Magnesia were harsher than those that existed under Athenian law.

Note: Harsh punishment

Magnesia women are full citizens alongside men, in reality he seems to have thought women 
Note: 2

inferior to men. He held that if men undertook the activities that were traditionally reserved for women, they would prove to be better at them; that men are more intelligent than women; that plundering the corpses on a battlefield is the mark of a womanish mind;

that a cowardly man would be reborn in his next incarnation as a woman; that women are more secretive and devious than men. Even in Laws women seem to be debarred from higher political offices. To put it at its harshest: Plato was less interested in women as women than he was in their potential to be men.


home were taught in a sporadic fashion, for a few weeks or a few years, by three kinds of teacher. A **grammatistēs taught them reading, writing, and arithmetic, and made them study and even learn and recite substantial chunks of epic poetry, since Homer,** especially, was regarded as a fount of wisdom in many areas (see figure 1.3). Plato would later criticize the expectation that by studying poetry people would be provided with role models to emulate; in his view, expressed especially in Republic, the gods and other characters described by Homer and others were often too corrupt to act as exemplars.
Note: Plato does not like folks rote memorizing homer to only quote the bard.

The other two schools were more specialized and more for **elite children**. **A kitharistēs** taught music, singing, dancing, and the lyric poets, 

paidotribēs supervised their physical education at a gymnasium (likely to be publicly owned) or “palaestra” (“wrestling-ground,” likely to be privately owned), to prepare them for all forms of athletic contest and for warfare. 

 biographies appear to know the names of Plato’s teachers: a certain Dionysius was his grammatistēs,19 Dracon of Athens and Metellus of Acragas were his kitharistai, and Ariston of Argos was his paidotribē

Plato sketched this aspect of a child’s education in Protagoras:21
Note: Protagoras sophist

To Plato’s mind, however, this was a hit-or-miss system: the eminent Athenian statesmen Themistocles and Pericles were good men (let’s suppose) and brought their sons up right, but the sons still turned out to be unexceptional.22 Why? Is excellence (virtue, aretē) not teachable? This question may even have been the spur that made Plato a philosopher. It is prominent in Meno and Protagoras and puts in an occasional appearance elsewhere.

gave him some notion of critical thinking, since the dramas, though set in the legendary past, invariably raised social and political issues that were relevant to contemporary Athens. Tragic poets were considered “the teachers of Greece.”23 Plato was growing up at a time when the tragedian Euripides, the most philosophical of the playwrights, was at the height of his popularity.
Note: Europides

However, Plato would later criticize drama as a form of rhetoric that could make people believe certain things but could not impart knowledge.
Note: in which work?

Plato is said to have studied painting, but that does not seem likely: it was not generally an upper-class pursuit. At least two of the writers who perpetuate this information point to a passage of Timaeus as evidence that Plato knew about

. But the story that he destroyed his early tragedies after his “conversion” to philosophy25 is such a cliché that we might be inclined to dismiss the whole set of tales as false, were it not for their plausibility. As a well-educated young man with literary aspirations, and also as a participant in symposia, it is very likely that he tried his hand at poetry. “I’ve had a kind of fascinated admiration for Homer ever since I was young,

 has Socrates say in Republic, surely speaking for himself.26 And Plato certainly had a sense of the tragic; no one who reads the sequence of dialogues surrounding Socrates’s trial and death (Apology of Socrates, Crito, Phaedo) can have any doubt about that.


Perhaps Plato felt that he was just too sane and rational to make a great poet.
 

 shall not bring shame upon my sacred weapons, nor shall I desert the man beside me, wherever I stand in the line. I shall fight in defense of things sacred and secular, and I shall not hand on the fatherland lessened, but greater and better as far as I am able and together with all. And I shall be obedient to those who exercise power reasonably at any time, and to the laws currently in force and any reasonably put into force in the future. If anyone destroys these, I shall not give him allegiance as far as is in my power and together with all. And I shall honor the ancestral religion.


his life, he never had to work to make money but lived off the labor of those who worked his estates. He was even said to have been the first not to charge for his teaching, though that distinction properly belongs to Socrates.

It was customary in Athens for well-off private citizens to be required to help out with public expenses. There was no regular income tax, but there were a few wealth

maintain a trireme (a warship) for a year, the hull of which was provided by the state. This extremely costly liturgy was undertaken on one occasion by Pyrilampes’s son Demos, which gives some idea of the wealth that Pyrilampes brought to Plato’s family when he married Perictione. The most expensive festival liturgy was the chorēgia, which involved recruiting a chorus for a dramatic or choral festival and paying for the trainers, the training, the rehearsals, the costumes, the scenery, and the equipment. This was the liturgy that Plato was called on to perform; 

The state assumed that Plato had at least several hundred drachmas to spare, and by complying with the order, Plato agreed. He was among the two thousand or so most wealthy men in Athens, truly a member of the top 1 percent. Even if we believe the story that Plato’s liturgical expenses were covered by someone else,

The bulk of his wealth seems to have come from two large farms in the countryside north and east of Athens, one inherited from his family and one that he bought himself.

I grant Artemis her freedom. I leave four house-slaves: Tychon, Bictas, Apollonides, and Dionysius. Household furniture as set down in the inventory, of which Demetrius has a copy. I owe no one any money.

translated such pride into snobbery. In a brilliant stretch of Republic,37 he first bemoans the fact that the kind of people who should take up philosophy are seduced away from it by the lure of worldly power and then vilifies the unsuitable people who, attracted by the prestige of philosophy, claim the field for themselves. He concludes with this savage little portrait:

impression these interlopers give is any different from that of a small, bald metalworker who’s come into some money? He’s just got himself out of debtors’ prison, he’s had a bath and is wearing brand-new clothes and a bridegroom’s outfit, and he’s about to marry his master’s daughter because she’s hard up and has no one to look after her.
Note: Vulgarian

By the same token, people from the working class in the fictional city-state of Republic are rigidly excluded from a share in government, on the grounds that their occupation makes it impossible for them to have the kind of lofty and

long-term thoughts that are appropriate to political leaders. Plato mellowed somewhat in his later years, but, under the influence in the first instance of his childhood upbringing, he shared not just his class’s pride in their wealth and education but also their snobbery about those who had to work for a living. In this sense, too, he was a man of his times.

Since he believed that the gods were only ever good, he came to reject stories of their lying, cheating, vindictiveness, and so on. “We’d better not admit into our city the story of 

Greek religion was based on practice rather than belief. There was no sacred text to whose provisions one had to adhere, no commandments or creed in which one had to believe in order to be “orthodox,” no Church to coordinate practice and develop doctrine. Religion was largely a matter of the appropriate performance of ritual. But ritual also rested 

on a bedrock of beliefs: that the gods exist, that they provide for us, that they know more and are more powerful than us, and that they can be moved by sacrifice and prayer.

petition them, it should not be for worldly prosperity, but only be for help in what is, essentially, one’s own doing. We have an example:39

Zeus and his extended Olympian family—but also of God in the singular. A few other thinkers before and during his lifetime did the same; the lineage began with Xenophanes of Colophon in the sixth/fifth century and included another follower of Socrates called Antisthenes. Plato was partaking in and giving impetus to a movement that would culminate only a few decades after his death in the monotheism

the Stoics, who saw the traditional gods more as the Semitic religions today see angels—as agents of God’s providence for the world. Plato sets off in that direction, especially in the astral theology he outlines in late dialogues such as Timaeus and Laws, where the heavenly bodies are gods that—in an almost astrological fashion—intermediate between God and humankind.

Notes: 9

Most ancient Greek literature has been lost, sometimes by accident, but more often because it was felt to be not worth preserving, in the sense that, in the centuries before the invention of the printing press, no one was asking scribes to make copies. Yet we have the complete set of Plato’s dialogues; not a single word that he published has been lost. Every generation of readers in antiquity and the Middle Ages felt that Plato’s work was worth preserving. In short, without Plato, European culture would be poorer, or at least it would have had to struggle to attain the same richness. Plato cannot be dismissed as just a dead white male. It is safe to say that, apart from the Bible, no body of written work has had such an impact on the Western world as Plato’s dialogues. Over the centuries, Platonism has reappeared in some form or other in philosophical contexts—in much early Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought; in the ideas of the Cambridge Platonists such as Henry More and Ralph Cudworth; in the slightly later seventeenth-century dispute between John Locke and Gottfried Leibniz; even in the late nineteenth-century “platonism” of Gottlob Frege’s mathematical philosophy. But that is not my point, which is that Plato bears some responsibility for forming and tuning the way all of us think, whatever our gender, skin color, cultural background, or philosophical or political affiliation. In saying this, I am not promoting the chauvinistic notion that the only discipline worthy of the name “philosophy” is the Western version, founded by Plato; but I am saying that, whether or not we know it, our minds have been affected by him. Moreover, I have suggested that he still has important lessons for us—that he should continue to affect the way we think about many of the issues that currently trouble or perplex us. This book, then, attempts to contextualize the work of this important thinker and to uncover as much as possible what else he did other than

nd indeed, the authenticity of any of Plato’s letters is one of the most hotly contested issues in Platonic scholarship. It is one of those issues that is subject to scholarly fashion. At the moment the scholarly consensus, while falling well short of unanimity, is that even the most plausible of them are forgeries, but in the middle of the twentieth century the consensus was the other way around, and there are signs today that the pendulum is swinging back again. They are not “forgeries” in the sense that there is anything malicious about them, as though the writer were trying to blacken Plato’s name in some way.

By contrast, we have about a million words from Aristotle’s pen, and if we had his lost works, the figure would probably be nearer three million. But prolificness is not the only criterion by which to judge a writer; Plato was creative and original in everything he wrote.

This is a good number of titles, but Plato was not an especially prolific writer: these twenty-eight dialogues amount to somewhat over 540,000 words,1 which is about the same as David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest.

I said just now that Plato raised questions that still provoke us, but the “us” in that sentence consists chiefly of practicing philosophers. It is more to the point to say that he raised questions that should still provoke us—all of us, not just philosophers. In a world in which even liberal democracies can be distorted by fanatical, incompetent, and emotionally immature leaders, should we perhaps not pay more attention to Plato’s prescriptions for turning out political leaders who are both competent and principled? In a world in which information and misinformation are more widespread than ever before, especially thanks to social media and the Internet, should we not reconsider Plato’s insistence that our actions should be based on knowledge, not belief or opinion?

The Sources

Notes: 15

Six ancient Lives of Plato exist in whole or part. Philodemus of Gadara, in the first century BCE, included a critical account of Plato’s life in the part of his massive History of the Philosophers that was dedicated to the history of the Academy. What remains of this text, however, is fragmentary: it exists only on carbonized papyrus rolls from Herculaneum in Italy, burned and preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE, and the delicate and highly technical work of reading the papyri is still ongoing. Moreover, what remains deals largely with the Academy; most of the details of Plato’s life are missing, and little is added in this respect to what we can gather from the other Lives, which have survived complete. These surviving Lives are, in chronological order: On Plato and His Teaching (second century CE), by the novelist and Platonist Apuleius of Madaurus; the third chapter of the Lives of the Eminent Philosophers (third century CE) by the biographer Diogenes Laertius; the opening sections of Commentary on Plato’s First Alcibiades (sixth century CE) by the Platonist scholar Olympiodorus the Younger; an anonymous Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy (sixth century CE); and the entry “Plato” in the Dictionary of Wise Men Distinguished in the Field of Intellectual Studies (sixth century CE), by Hesychius of Miletus.1

Common sense is the best tool with which to assess anecdotes, and it is not difficult to dismiss out of hand the notion that members of the Academy, Plato’s school, used to blind themselves so that they would not be distracted from philosophy, or that Plato died of shame when he was unable to answer a riddle.

Speusippus

07.06.2023 17:16

The tradition’s roots go back to the fourth century BCE because biographies, memoirs, and commemorative poems were written by some of Plato’s followers and others in the decades immediately after his death in 347: Aristotle and Speusippus wrote poems; Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Philip of Opus wrote biographies, probably of an encomiastic nature; Erastus of Scepsis and a certain Asclepiades wrote memoirs. In the next generation, Dicaearchus of Messana, Satyrus of Collatis, and Neanthes of Cyzicus wrote biographies, and Clearchus of Soli wrote an encomium, perhaps trying to counteract the effect of hostile accounts of Plato, because they too started early: Theopompus of Chios wrote a work Against the School of Plato, in which he seems to have charged Plato with writing many falsehoods and focusing on stuff that was useless; Idomeneus of Lampsacus wrote a book On the Followers of Socrates that recounted gossipy scandals; Aristoxenus of Taras’s Life of Plato, as far as we can tell from the few surviving fragments, drew on gossipy anecdotes and accused Plato of plagiarism and much else besides; Phaenias of Eresus must have included something about Plato in his On the Socratics; the Sicilian historian Philistus wrote a hostile account of Plato’s visits to Sicily; and comic playwrights were ridiculing Plato even during his lifetime, though not all their remarks were hostile: he is mocked above all for his obscurity, his dependence on wealthy patrons, and the uselessness of philosophy, but these were standard slurs about intellectuals.2

Letter 7 is not bland.

The details of Plato’s youthful turn toward philosophy are completely plausible, as even those who doubt the letter’s authenticity agree.
