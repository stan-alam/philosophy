Yet we have the complete set of Plato’s dialogues; not a single word that he published has been lost. Every generation of readers in antiquity and the Middle Ages felt that Plato’s work was worth preserving.
In short, without Plato, European culture would be poorer, or at least it would have had to struggle to attain the same richness. Plato cannot be dismissed as just a dead white male. It is safe to say that, apart from the Bible, no body of written work has had such an impact on the Western world as Plato’s dialogues. Over the centuries, Platonism has reappeared in some form or other in philosophical contexts—in much early Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought; in the ideas of the Cambridge Platonists such as Henry More and Ralph Cudworth; in the slightly later seventeenth-century dispute between John Locke and Gottfried Leibniz; even in the late nineteenth-century “platonism” of Gottlob Frege’s mathematical philosophy. But that is not my point, which is that Plato bears some responsibility for forming and tuning the way all of us think, whatever our gender, skin color, cultural background, or philosophical or political affiliation. In saying this, I am not promoting the chauvinistic notion that the only discipline worthy of the name “philosophy” is the Western version, founded by Plato; but I am saying that, whether or not we know it, our minds have been affected by him. Moreover, I have suggested that he still has important lessons for us—that he should continue to affect the way we think about many of the issues that currently trouble or perplex us.

Philodemus of Gadara, in the first century BCE, included a critical account of Plato’s life in the part of his massive History of the Philosophers that was dedicated to the history of the Academy. What remains of this text, however, is fragmentary: it exists only on carbonized papyrus rolls from Herculaneum in Italy, burned and preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE, and the delicate and highly technical work of reading the papyri is still ongoing. Moreover, what remains deals largely with the Academy; most of the details of Plato’s life are missing, and little is added in this respect to what we can gather from the other Lives, which have survived complete. These surviving Lives are, in chronological order: On Plato and His Teaching (second century CE), by the novelist and Platonist Apuleius of Madaurus; the third chapter of the Lives of the Eminent Philosophers (third century CE) by the biographer Diogenes Laertius; the opening sections of Commentary on Plato’s First Alcibiades (sixth century CE) by the Platonist scholar Olympiodorus the Younger; an anonymous Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy (sixth century CE); and the entry “Plato” in the Dictionary of Wise Men Distinguished in the Field of Intellectual Studies (sixth century CE), by Hesychius of Miletus.1</div><div class="cell notetext hyphens"></div><div class="cell pagedate">31/216</div><div class="cell pagedate">07.06.202317:15</div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="table"><div style="background-color: yellow;" class="cell notecolor"></div><div class="cell notecontext hyphens">The tradition’s roots go back to the fourth century BCE because biographies, memoirs, and commemorative poems were written by some of Plato’s followers and others in the decades immediately after his death in 347: Aristotle and Speusippus wrote poems; Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Philip of Opus wrote biographies, probably of an encomiastic nature; Erastus of Scepsis and a certain Asclepiades wrote memoirs. In the next generation, Dicaearchus of Messana, Satyrus of Collatis, and Neanthes of Cyzicus wrote biographies, and Clearchus of Soli wrote an encomium, perhaps trying to counteract the effect of hostile accounts of Plato, because they too started early: Theopompus of Chios wrote a work Against the School of Plato, in which he seems to have charged Plato with writing many falsehoods and focusing on stuff that was useless; Idomeneus of Lampsacus wrote a book On the Followers of Socrates that recounted gossipy scandals; Aristoxenus of Taras’s Life of Plato, as far as we can tell from the few surviving fragments, drew on gossipy anecdotes and accused Plato of plagiarism and much else besides; Phaenias of Eresus must have included something about Plato in his On the Socratics; the Sicilian historian Philistus wrote a hostile account of Plato’s visits to Sicily; and comic playwrights were ridiculing Plato even during his lifetime, though not all their remarks were hostile: he is mocked above all for his obscurity, his dependence on wealthy patrons, and the uselessness of philosophy, but these were standard slurs about intellectuals.2</div><div class="cell notetext hyphens"></div><div class="cell pagedate">32/216</div><div class="cell pagedate">07.06.202317:15</div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="table"><div style="background-color: yellow;" class="cell notecolor"></div><div class="cell notecontext hyphens"> Common sense is the best tool with which to assess anecdotes, and it is not difficult to dismiss out of hand the notion that members of the Academy, Plato’s school, used to blind themselves so that they would not be distracted from philosophy, or that Plato died of shame when he was unable to answer a riddle.</div><div class="cell notetext hyphens"></div><div class="cell pagedate">32/216</div><div class="cell pagedate">07.06.202317:17</div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="table"><div style="background-color: red;" class="cell notecolor"></div><div class="cell notecontext hyphens">Xenocrates succeeded Speusippus.</div><div class="cell notetext hyphens"></div><div class="cell pagedate">32/216</div><div class="cell pagedate">07.06.202317:16</div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="table"><div style="background-color: red;" class="cell notecolor"></div><div class="cell notecontext hyphens">Speusippus</div><div class="cell notetext hyphens"></div><div class="cell pagedate">32/216</div><div class="cell pagedate">07.06.202317:16</div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="table"><div style="background-color: yellow;" class="cell notecolor"></div><div class="cell notecontext hyphens">not fraud; the writer is more likely to be honoring Plato than disrespecting him. </div><div class="cell notetext hyphens"></div><div class="cell pagedate">33/216</div><div class="cell pagedate">07.06.202317:18</div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="table"><div style="background-color: purple;" class="cell notecolor"></div><div class="cell notecontext hyphens">Syracusan and southern Italian rulers and statesmen with whom Plato interacted on his visits to the central Mediterranean.</div><div class="cell notetext hyphens"></div><div class="cell pagedate">33/216</div><div class="cell pagedate">07.06.202317:18</div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="table"><div style="background-color: yellow;" class="cell notecolor"></div><div class="cell notecontext hyphens"> accretion of spurious ones</div><div class="cell notetext hyphens"></div><div class="cell pagedate">33/216</div><div class="cell pagedate">07.06.202317:19</div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="table"><div style="background-color: red;" class="cell notecolor"></div><div class="cell notecontext hyphens">nd indeed, the authenticity of any of Plato’s letters is one of the most hotly contested issues in Platonic scholarship.
