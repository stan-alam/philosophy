Aristotle


 One of the first books I recall reading, after I learned Italian in my fortieth year, was Carlo Natali’s scholarly study on Aristotle’s biography and the establishment of the Lyceum, BIOS THEORETIKOS: la vita di Aristotele e l’organizzazione della sua scuola (Bologna 1991). I found it to be a masterful demonstration of the skill of marshalling complex information; and a stable and more detailed picture of Aristotle came into focus for me. I thought I was an expert in Aristotle, as I had read many books on Aristotle in the course of my university career; but I had never seen such a quantity of information about who Aristotle really was, some derived from extraordinarily arcane sources,

It gives me great pleasure to present this translated and updated version of Carlo Natali’s book to English readers. I am confident that Aristotle: His Life and School will serve as the new modern standard biography of Aristotle, and the essential starting point for all future research on the person of Aristotle and on the intellectual way of life that he pioneered.

Note: 01

his Nicomachean Ethics is the most widely studied book of moral philosophy at present on North American university campuses. Aristotle invented a new way of being an intellectual and his legacy as an institution-builder is profound: he founded an institution dedicated to advancing the life of the mind and the progress of the sciences, a research and teaching institution that is the distant forerunner of modern scientific learned societies.

There were two celebrated attempts to do this in the twentieth century, both of which remain classics in the field: Werner Jaeger’s Aristotle (1923, translated into English in 1934), and Ingemar Düring’s Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition (1957). For judicious evaluations of these books, readers are invited to consult Natali’s comments on them (these can be located by using the indexed bibliography compiled for this updated English edition). It is not my place to evaluate the contributions made by these two books, but this surely is the place for me to point out to my readers the virtues of Natali’s book.

 In his introduction (1990), Natali reflected on what it would be to succeed at his task, starting from criteria derived from George Steiner. The biography of a philosopher should “seek to make the biographical

With Aristotle, the situation is entirely reversed: not a single archival document survives from the classical period; Aristotle’s personality was not morbidly self-expressive in the way that Rousseau’s clearly was (I cannot conceive of Aristotle writing a work like Rousseau’s Confessions); the facts and probabilities about key events need to be puzzled out on the basis of later ancient scholarly sources, all of whose works have themselves been lost in their original forms, except to the extent that there are damaged papyrus fragments remaining, or portions of their work that happen to have survived in one or more medieval manuscripts and have received a modern printed edition.

Access to the scattered exiguous information on Aristotle is multiply indirect, and often compromised into uncertainty by the agendas of the ancient (or modern) scholars who transmit it. The brilliance of a successful

I became acquainted with Carlo Natali in 1997–98 in Padua, where I was spending the year as a guest of our colleague Enrico Berti. After I had commented on a draft of an English translation of Natali’s book La Saggezza di Aristotele (published in 2001 as The Wisdom of Aristotle), I suggested to him that this book, his BIOS THEORETIKOS, needed to be translated into English as well; and when the idea was offered to Princeton University Press in 1998, the publisher was receptive. A contract was later proposed and entered into by PUP, a professional translator was engaged, and funds were sought and found to pay for the translating. Although progress was made, the project got stuck for a number of years, and things seemed hopeless when I learned the unfortunate story from Natali several years ago;

evening, resolved that we should rescue it and bring it to completion ourselves. The next stage of work was done by Monte Johnson, and then the file was handed over to me, and I began to check the accuracy of the Italian translation.
Note: 07


 It was at this point that I noticed a systematic problem in the draft of the book, that the original translator had used “standard translations,” such as those in the Loeb Classical Library, to render the Greek and Latin passages that form the evidence base, whereas the original Italian translations that Natali had made for the first edition differed sometimes in significant ways. On some occasions the “standard translations” contradicted or undermined the line of thought for which Natali was arguing. To sort all this out, it was in fact necessary to find someone who knew all the relevant languages and who also understood the sometimes subtle historiography of the author; the professional translator needed to be supplemented or replaced by a professor translating.

Minar Jr. in translating Walter Burkert’s book Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism (first German edition 1962, English edition 1972), and by the Oxford philosopher Richard Robinson in translating Werner Jaeger’s book Aristotle: Fundamentals of the History of His Development (first German edition 1923, English edition 1934, revised 1948).

the case of papyrus texts, words in bold are translations of words fully legible in Greek, but words that are printed partly in bold are only partly legible in the papyrus; words and parts of words that are not in bold are supplemented wholly or partly by scholars, with more or less reliability; the result of this convention is a mottled effect which gives a visual impression
Note: 7

One effect of these decisions was that I carried out a sort of repetition of Natali’s original philological procedures, the classical studies equivalent of repeating a scientific experiment. Every passage from ancient sources was independently translated by me, on the basis of the best critical editions (many of which were not available to Natali twenty years ago), and then confirmed by e-mail with Natali, especially where there were real or apparent differences in construal. This collaborative process resulted in many smaller and a few larger revisions to the primary evidence portions of the book, the more important of which will be mentioned below. But the most important result was deep confirmation: with the exception of one passage only (see below), we agree with each other on the proper construal of every ancient passage, and the ancient portions of the book are in effect doubly translated.

Note: 04


 The long passage of time since the first edition made it opportune for the English edition to include a postscript by the author, to take stock of intervening developments in scholarship. The postscript (p. 145) serves to update the reader on several fronts of recent research, but it mostly confirms the stability and solidity of Natali’s interpretations of the evidence, which have not been shaken by subsequent studies. His postscript was finalized in July of 2012, but in the intervening six months we have noticed several further contributions relevant to the topics of this book, contributions that I mention at the end of this preface.

 On Demosthenes by Didymus of Alexandria, which is mostly lost except for papyrus fragments recently reedited by P. Harding; the same epigram of Theocritus was also cited in the lost work On Philosophy by Aristocles of Messene (recently re-edited by M. L. Chiesara), of which large excerpts are cited by Eusebius; so there are index entries leading to this epigram on this page under “Theocritus,” “Bryon,” “Didymus” (with bibliographical details to Harding’s edition), “Aristocles” (with bibliographical details to Chiesara’s edition), and “Eusebius.” As well as providing access from passages to locations in the book, the index of sources also tracks the networks of nested sources.
 The bibliographical index is an expansion of the original bibliography

important modern books, such as Jaeger’s Aristotle and Düring’s Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition, I have provided fuller indexes that guide the reader from specific pages in these books

 to pages in this book. Certain specialized sources, such as the Vita Marciana (surviving in Greek in a single damaged manuscript in Venice) and the other ancient Lives, are indexed according to the subdivisions printed in Düring’s book. I decided to provide the primary references of such texts in terms of Düring’s reference system, relegating to the index Gigon’s Prussian Academy edition, which has not succeeded in becoming the currently standard edition of this material; but the index provides cross-references to enable those scholars who can afford its high price to work with Gigon’s book as well as or instead of Düring

, because Harding’s 2006 edition of the papyrus fragments of Didymus cleared up most of the problems and confusions that made the note necessary.
 Some accidentally mistaken or cryptic references have been corrected, or given in more detailed form. Some bibliographical references and cross-references have been provided with more information (never with less). Abbreviations of ancient names have been expanded. I have generally suppressed the ellipses in citations, preferring to cite the whole passage in full, or else to break the citation into two determinate ones. All chapter and section divisions and most paragraph divisions have been preserved, but a few paragraphs have been split or combined when I judged this an improvement. I used my judgment freely in splitting or combining sentences or clauses for the sake of the English version, and in placing reference information within sentences. I am responsible for all the final details of the translation, which I tried to make as literal and precise as possible.

Note: 02

For example, from 2005 to 2012 Douglas Olson published a much-needed new edition of Athenaeus with Loeb, in eight volumes; the study of Strabo was put on a new foundation by Stefan Radt, who published ten substantial volumes from 2002 to 2011, of edition, translation, and commentary; and the Research on Plants by Theophrastus was published for Les Belles Lettres in five volumes by Suzanne Amigues from 1988 to 2006. The old edition by Wimmer of the fragments of Theophrastus has now been replaced by eight volumes published since 1991 on Theophrastus of Eresus: Sources for His Life, Writings, Thought, and Influence, edited by W. Fortenbaugh, P. Huby, R. Sharples, and D. Gutas. We also benefitted from the new edition of the Theophrastean On Weather Signs, edited by D. Sider and C. W. Brunschön, who supplied some new facts related on p. 107. New work to replace Wehrli’s Die Schule des Aristoteles has brought new light to the study of Dicaearchus, with a 2001 edition of his fragments by

 field of evidence, the report from Aristocles of Messene about the seventy-five bronze saucepans allegedly carried by Aristotle on his escape from Athens to Chalcis in 322 (see p. 132). In his original publication, Natali was relying on a nineteenth-century edition of Eusebius, who quotes Aristocles in lengthy excerpts, including his incredulous comment about the “very stupid story” that customs

officials in Chalcis had discovered seventy-four bronze frypans on board Aristotle’s ship. In her 2001 edition of the fragments of Aristocles, Maria Lorenza Chiesara revised this number to seventy-five, based on new collations of manuscripts of this and a related passage. When working with this evidence, I realized that “frypans” is not the correct translation of the noun in question; it is rather a large collection of “saucepans” that was allegedly discovered (see note 23 to chapter 4). Perhaps it makes no difference whether the hostile story was about seventy-four frypans or seventy-five saucepans; and yet when we reflect that the Greek for “saucepan” is a diminutive of the word meaning “platter” or “plaque,” the possibility arises that what was discovered was a priceless archival collection of inscribed bronze plaques. If so, the so-called “stupid” story may well be a sly distortion of an interesting fact, rather than an invention ex nihilo.

 When an ancient text is transmitted by a single damaged papyrus, improvements can often be brought about by fresh scrutiny of the document with modern techniques, including multispectral imaging.
Note: 09.12.23

This is currently happening with the works of Philodemus, the Epicurean scholar whose books were discovered in carbonized scrolls in Herculaneum, and we have benefited from the new edition of David Blank of the end of Philodemus’ On Rhetoric (pp. 27–29). We base our translation of the relevant passages on this new edition, which supersedes what was available to Natali in 1990, including more responsible supplementation of gaps in the document.
