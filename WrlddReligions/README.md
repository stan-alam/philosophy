## Workspace on 'World Religions'

```text
The World’s Religions, by beloved author and pioneering professor Huston Smith (Tales of Wonder),
is the definitive classic for introducing the essential elements and teachings of the world's
predominant faiths, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Judaism, Christianity,
Islam, as well as regional native traditions.

This revised and updated edition provides sympathetic descriptions of the various traditions,
explaining how they work “from the inside,” which is a big reason why this cherished classic has
sold more than two million copies since it first appeared in 1958.
