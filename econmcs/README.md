## notes on economics

```text
When it comes drawing on enduring economic principles to explain current economic
realities, there is no one readers trust more than Paul Krugman. With his
bestselling introductory textbook (now in a new edition) the Nobel laureate and New York
Times columnist is proving to be equally effective in the classroom, with more and more
instructors in all types of schools using Krugman’s signature storytelling style to help
them introduce the fundamental principles of economics to all kinds of students.
Paul Krugman, recipient of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, is Professor of
Economics at Princeton University, where he regularly teaches the principles course.
He received his BA from Yale and his PhD from MIT. Prior to his current position, he
taught at Yale, Stanford, and MIT. He also spent a year on staff of the Council of
Economics Advisors in 1982-1983. His research is mainly in the area of international
trade, where he is one of the founders of the “new trade theory,” which focuses on
increasing returns and imperfect competition. He also works in international finance,
with a concentration in currency crises. In 1991, Krugman received the American
Economic Association’s John Bates Clark medal. In addition to his teaching and
academic research, Krugman writes extensively for nontechnical audiences. Krugman
is a regular op-ed columnist for the New York Times.
