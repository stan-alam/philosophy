## notes on the 'The Third Revolution: Xi Jinping and the New Chinese State.'

```text
n The Third Revolution, eminent China scholar Elizabeth C. Economy provides an
incisive look at the transformative changes underway in China today. Chinese leader
Xi Jinping has unleashed a powerful set of political and economic reforms: the
centralization of power under Xi, himself, the expansion of the Communist Party's
role in Chinese political, social, and economic life, and the construction of a
virtual wall of regulations to control more closely the exchange of ideas and
capital between China and the outside world. Beyond its borders, Beijing has recast
itself as a great power, seeking to reclaim its past glory and to create a system of
international norms that better serves its more ambitious geostrategic objectives.
In so doing, the Chinese leadership is reversing the trends toward greater political
and economic opening, as well as the low-profile foreign policy, that had been put in
motion by Deng Xiaoping's "Second Revolution" thirty years earlier.

Through a wide-ranging exploration of Xi Jinping's top political, economic and foreign
policy priorities-fighting corruption, managing the Internet, reforming the state-owned
enterprise sector, improving the country's innovation capacity, enhancing air quality,
and elevating China's presence on the global stage-Economy identifies the tensions,
shortcomings, and successes of Xi's reform efforts over the course of his first five
years in office. She also assesses their implications for the rest of the world, and
provides recommendations for how the United States and others should navigate their
relationship with this vast nation in the coming years.
