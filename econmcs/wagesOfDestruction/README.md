## notes on The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy

```text
An extraordinary mythology has grown up around the Third Reich that hovers over political and 
moral debate even today. Adam Tooze's controversial book challenges the conventional economic 
interpretations of that period to explore how Hitler's surprisingly prescient vision--ultimately 
hindered by Germany's limited resources and his own racial ideology--was to create a German 
super-state to dominate Europe and compete with what he saw as America's overwhelming power in a 
soon-to- be globalized world. The Wages of Destruction is a chilling work of originality and 
tremendous scholarship that set off debate in Germany and will fundamentally change the way 
in which history views the Second World War.
