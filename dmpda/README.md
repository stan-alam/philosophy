## notes on Dhammapada

```text
Dhammapada means “the path of dharma,” the path of truth, harmony, and righteousness. Eknath Easwaran’s
translation of this essential Buddhist text, based on the oldest version, consists of 423 short verses
gathered by the Buddha’s direct disciples after his death and organized by theme: anger, thought, joy,
pleasure, and others. The Buddha’s timeless teachings take the form of vivid metaphors from everyday
life and are well served by Easwaran’s lucid translation. An authoritative introduction and chapter
notes offer helpful context for modern readers.
