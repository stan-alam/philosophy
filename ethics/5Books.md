The phrase ‘If God does not exist, everything is permitted’ is often attributed to Dostoevsky.

[Practical Ethics by Peter Singer](https://fivebooks.com/book/practical-ethics-by-peter-singer/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> [“_Practical Ethics_ came out in 1979, just before I began studying philosophy. I loved its rigour, and I found Peter Singer almost impossible to argue with. I agreed with almost every position he took on every issue. There were chapters on abortion, on animal rights, on how much money we can give to the poor. It’s really the blueprint for everything he’s written subsequently. He is prolific, but if you want to know what Singer believes on a given topic, you may as well go back to _Practical Ethics_. There’s a whole chapter on the fact that if we know that people are going to die in the Third World and we fail to do something about it, we’re as responsible for their murder as if we put a bullet through their heads. It’s a very practical book which addresses these controversial issues. I became a vegetarian at university after reading it, so it had a big effect on my life. I’ve since moved away from his very rigid utilitarianism on other topics, but I still find his arguments about how we should treat animals very persuasive.”](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/david-edmonds-ethical-problems/#book-6269)

Modern living is an ethical minefield.  How should we behave in private and in public, what are our duties to others?  How do these things change in a world where we run up against people with very different answers to our own? We have a very extensive range of interviews with some of the world's most eminent philosophers discussing books on these knotty problems of contemporary morality from every angle as well as more perennial ethical issues, such as the existence, or otherwise, of free will.

On issues with a very particular contemporary resonance, Paul Boddington discusses [ethics for artificial intelligence](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/ethics-artificial-intelligence/), Louise Gray chooses her [best books on the ethics of eating meat](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/eating-meat-louise-gray-ethical-carnivore/) and  Donna Dickenson talks about [body shopping](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/donna-dickenson-on-body-shopping/).  Hugh Gusterson talks about [drone warfare](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/hugh-gusterson-drone-warfare/), Clive Stafford Smith discusses [capital punishment](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/clive-stafford-smith-on-capital-punishment/), Juan Mendez discusses [torture](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/juan-mendez-on-torture/) and Mary Robinson talks about [climate justice](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/climate-justice-mary-robinson/).  Anthony Julius discusses [censorship](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/anthony-julius-on-censorship/).  Alex Carlile talks about [ethics in public life](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/alex-carlile-on-ethics-in-public-life/) and A C Grayling discusses [being good in the modern world](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/ac-grayling-being-good/).  Peter Berkovitz talks about [liberty and morality](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/peter-berkowitz-on-liberty-and-morality/).

Meanwhile, on more perennial themes, Paul Russell discusses [free will and responsibility](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/free-will-responsibility-paul-russell/), Jonathan Glover discusses [moral philosophy](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/jonathan-glover-moral-philosophy/) and both [Mary Warnock](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/mary-warnock-godless-morality/) and [Kenan Malik](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/kenan-malik-on-morality-without-god/) choose their best books on morality without God.  Edward Skidelsky chooses his [best books on virtue](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/virtue-edward-skidelsky/) and Adam Haslett his on [evil](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/adam-haslett-on-evil/).  Paula Fredriksen discusses [sin](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/paula-fredriksen-on-sin/).  Kwame Anthony Appiah discusses the philosophical underpinnings of [honour](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/kwame-anthony-appiah-on-honour/).  Will MacAskill talks about [effective altruism](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/effective-altruism-will-macaskill/) and David Edmomds discusses how to apply philosophical thinking to practical [ethical problems](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/david-edmonds-ethical-problems/).

Beyond that we have interviews covering books on [moral character](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/moral-character-christian-miller/), [eugenics](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/eugenics-philippa-levine/), [deceit](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/dallas-denery-deceit/), [assassination](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/lindsay-porter-on-assassination/) and more.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By teaching philosophy in prisons, British philosopher Andy West was not only able to engage with core issues of the human condition, but also to come to terms with members of his own family’s experience of being in prison. Here, he talks us through some books that deal with being locked up, from Auschwitz to Vancouver Island, as well as one by a victim of violent crime.
