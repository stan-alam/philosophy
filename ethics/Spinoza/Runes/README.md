Therefore, freedom of thought and freedom of speech are the fundamental rights of the citizen.                                                                            |

How to reach that goal, to see the panorama of daily existence sub specie aeternitatis, he endeavored to explain in the book before us.                                                                                                                                                              |

It bears close resemblance to the Cabalistic idea of 1) chochmah, wisdom; 2) binah, reason, and 3) da at, perception.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
