## Clincal Spinoza
```text
Discovering Spinoza's early modern psychology some 35 years 
into his own clinical practice, Ian Miller now gives shape to 
this connection through a close reading of Spinoza's 
key philosophical ideas.

With a rigorous and expansive analysis of Spinoza's Ethics 
in particular, Miller explores how Spinozan thought simultaneously 
empowered the original conceptual direction of psychoanalytic thinking, 
and anticipated the field's contemporary theoretical dimensions. 
Miller offers a detailed overview of the philosopher's psychoanalytic 
reception from the early work of German-langauge psychoanalytic thinkers, 
such as Freud and Lou Andreas-Salom√©, forward into its Anglophone reception, 
influencing both mid-century humanistic American psychoanalysis as well as 
anticipating thinkers such as Bion and Winnicott.

Covering key concepts in psychoanalytic theory and clinical practice, 
this book demonstrates how knowledge of Spinoza's philosophical work 
can help to both illulminate and improve modern psychoanalytic therapies.
