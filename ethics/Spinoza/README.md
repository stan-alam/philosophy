## Spinoza

The person who is virtuous in Spinoza’s idiosyncratic sense will also exhibit

those traits of character and modes of behavior that are traditionally regarded as ‘virtues’—

ethical and social virtues—all of which follow naturally from his rational pursuit

of self-interest. ‘A man who is guided by reason’ will have ‘strength of character’. He

‘hates no one, is angry with no one, envies no one, is indignant with no one, scorns no

one, and is not at all proud’; he will avoid ‘whatever he thinks is troublesome and evil,

and moreover, whatever seems immoral, dreadful, unjust and dishonorable’ (4p73s).
