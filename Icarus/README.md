## notes on Icarus

```text
In Seth Godin’s most inspiring book, he challenges readers to find the courage to
treat their work as a form of art

Everyone knows that Icarus’s father made him wings and told him not to fly too
close to the sun; he ignored the warning and plunged to his doom. The lesson: Play
it safe. Listen to the experts. It was the perfect propaganda for the industrial
economy. What boss wouldn’t want employees to believe that obedience and conformity
are the keys to success?

But we tend to forget that Icarus was also warned not to fly too low, because seawater
would ruin the lift in his wings. Flying too low is even more dangerous than flying too
high, because it feels deceptively safe.

The safety zone has moved. Conformity no longer leads to comfort. But the good news is
that creativity is scarce and more valuable than ever. So is choosing to do something
unpredictable and brave: Make art. Being an artist isn’t a genetic disposition or a specific
talent. It’s an attitude we can all adopt. It’s a hunger to seize new ground, make
connections, and work without a map. If you do those things you’re an artist,
no matter what it says on your business card.

Godin shows us how it’s possible and convinces us why it’s essential.
