Heaven and Hell

My scholarship led me to realize that the Bible was a very human book, with human mistakes and biases and culturally conditioned views in it. And

. A recent Pew Research Poll showed that 72 percent of all Americans agree that there is a literal heaven where people go when they die; 58 percent believe in an actual, literal hell.1 These numbers are, of course, down seriously from previous periods, but they are still impressive.

Note: 03


 One of the surprising theses of this book is that these views do not go back to the earliest stages of Christianity. They cannot be found in the Old Testament and they are not what Jesus himself taught. Then where did they come from?

Note: 04.

Even within the New Testament, different key figures promoted divergent understandings. The apostle Paul had different views of the afterlife from Jesus, whose views were not the same as those found in the Gospel of Luke or the Gospel of John or the

I’m saying that the ideas of heaven and hell were invented and have been altered over the years.

Western culture, as far back as we have written records, people believed everyone experienced the same fate after death, an uninteresting, feeble, and rather boring eternity in a place often called

Hades. This is the view clearly set forth in Homer’s Odyssey.

But eventually people came to think this could not be right, largely because it was not fair. If there are gods with anything like our moral code who oversee the world, there must be justice, both in this life and the next. That must mean that faithful, well-meaning, and virtuous people in the world will be rewarded for how they live, and the wicked will be punished. This is the view that developed next, as we will see in the writings of Plato.

 Starting in the sixth century BCE, Hebrew prophets began to proclaim that the nation that had been destroyed would be restored to life by God. In a sense, it would be “raised from the dead.

not of the people who lived in the nation but a restoration of the nation Israel itself—to become, once more, a sovereign 
Note: 12

Toward the very end of the Old Testament period, some Jewish thinkers came to believe this future “resurrection” would apply not to the fortunes of the nation but to individuals.
Note: 13

Jesus of Nazareth inherited this view and forcefully proclaimed it. Those who did God’s will would be rewarded at the end, raised from the dead to live forever in a glorious kingdom here on earth. Those opposed to God would be punished by being annihilated out of existence. For Jesus this was to happen very soon.
Note: 14

After Jesus’s death, his disciples carried on his message, even as they transformed it in light of the new circumstances they came to face. Among other things, the expected end never did come, which led to a reevaluation of Jesus’s original message. Some of his followers came to think that God’s vindication of his followers would not be delayed until the end of human
Note: 14

It would happen to each person at the point of death. Believers in Christ would be taken into the presence of Christ in heaven as they awaited the return to their bodies at the future resurrection. Those opposed to God, however, would be punished. Eventually Christians came to think this punishment would not entail annihilation (Jesus’s view) but torment, and not just for a short day or two but forever.

claiming to be by Peter, which in some respects was the most intriguing of all. This was an account, written in the first person, of a guided tour of the afterlife, a detailed description of the torments of sinners in hell, and, in far less detail, the blessings of saints in heaven. It is the earliest Christian forerunner of Dante’s Divine Comedy and the most authoritative such account ever to appear—allegedly authenticated by one of Jesus’s own apostles.

part of the New Testament, with church leaders arguing whether it, rather than the Apocalypse of John (the book of Revelation), should be included in the canon. Eventually it lost this battle and then disappeared from sight, until serendipitously uncovered by our French archaeologists.1

Note: Slavery

It is surprising that such a detailed and graphic description of eternal torment would be accompanied by only a brief and vague description of the blessings of the saints, but such is the case. Possibly eternal joy is not as satisfying to describe as everlasting torture.
Note: See Mark Twain...easily to describe hell...heaven would be boring

Seeing your enemies horribly tortured for eternity is apparently considered one of the greatest joys possible. This may not exactly be consistent with Jesus’s instruction to “love your enemies,” but texts like this regularly
Note: 18

He is not so much scaring the hell out of people as scaring people out of hell.4 And even though his descriptions of paradise are remarkably vague, they contribute to the same end. Which do you, as a reader, want? Do you want to spend eternity hanging by your genitals over eternal flame, standing in a deep pit up to your knees in excrement, having your flesh perpetually shredded into pieces by ravenous birds?


 The book, called the Passion of Perpetua,

This is no ordinary ladder, however. It is enormously high (as one might expect) and has attached to its sides “all sorts of metal weapons… swords, spears, hooks, daggers, and spikes,” so that, as Perpetua says, “if anyone tried to climb up carelessly or without paying attention, he would be mangled and his flesh would adhere to

 her: “Do not let the dragon bite you.” Perpetua assures him that the dragon “will not harm me in the name of Christ Jesus”—then boldly moves to the first rung of the ladder by stepping on the serpent’s head. The devil holds no terror for her, since she has faith in her savior.

an immense garden.” In it is a “grey-haired man… in shepherd’s garb,” milking sheep. Perpetua does not identify who this is, but the Christian reader has no difficulty recognizing the “Good Shepherd” as Christ himself. He is “grey-haired” because, as other Christians have said, he is the one who has existed before time, who chose to come into the world to save sinners, “the first and the last, the alpha and the omega” (Revelation 1:8; 22:13).
 Around the shepherd are thousands of people clad in white: others of the saved who had already made the heavenly ascent.

She wakes up and tells her brother the news: they will not be released from prison but are to suffer and die, and so find their eternal reward. They will be martyred.
 And so it happens. The end of the narrative, allegedly written by a different author in the third person, describes how Perpetua and her fellow Christians refuse to recant and are thrown to the wild beasts in the arena, viciously mauled to their gory deaths.

. The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (121–80 CE) maligned Christians who insisted on dying out of obstinacy (Meditations 11.3). And the Latin satirist Lucian of Samosata (120–after 180 CE) spoke of Christians as “wretched people” who “have convinced themselves that they will be immortal and live forever, which leads the majority of them to despise death and willingly give themselves up to it.”

 are never told how, exactly, the two could be brothers, let alone twins. Possibly ancient Christians thought that, just as the pagan demigod Hercules was reputed to have a mortal brother, Iphicles (his divinely impregnated mother had been made pregnant as well by her mortal husband), so too did their own divinity, Jesus.
Note: Oh. Ok

. The best preserved of these stories gives an extended account of Thomas’s missionary activities. Even today many people think of Thomas as the first to bring the gospel to India. That tradition goes back to the second-century account known as the Acts of Thomas.

 Jesus tracks down his brother, Judas Thomas, and brings him to Abban, who points to Jesus and asks, “Is this your master?” What can Thomas say? He has to admit it: Jesus is indeed his lord and master. Abban then shows him the bill of sale and Thomas realizes he has been duped and sold into slavery. Against all his wishes, he embarks with Abban back to India, where he will be used to ply his trade.
Note: 04

Once again, the point of the story is clear. It is a narrative exposition of the words of Jesus: “Sell your possessions and give to charity; make for yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure that does not fail, in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth corrupts. For where your treasure is, there also will be your heart” (Luke 12:33–34). Sometimes it takes a near-death experience to show people how to live on this side of eternity.

cannot be found either in the Old Testament or in the teachings of the historical Jesus. To put it succinctly: the founder of Christianity did not believe that the soul of a person who died would go to heaven or hell.
 But this became the standard Christian view over time, and it will be helpful to see where it ultimately came from, when it started to be adopted, and why it seemed so attractive. These are important questions, because belief in a literal heaven and hell continues to be held by most Christians in the world today—that is by millions,

As usual, Shakespeare put it best. In Measure for Measure, Claudio, facing his execution, bemoans:

The weariest and most loathed worldly life
 That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment

 Now, four centuries later, we have not conquered this fear 


 The epic of Gilgamesh is the longest literary composition in Akkadian (Old Babylonian) and one of the the oldest narratives in our literary canon. The epic was unknown for many centuries until unearthed on clay tablets in the mid-nineteenth century, discovered in archaeological excavations of Nineveh, the ancient capital of Assyria. The tablets, composed in cuneiform script and dating from the seventh century BCE, created an international sensation, in no small measure because, once deciphered, they were recognized as preserving a “flood narrative” from centuries

before the biblical accounts of Noah. This older Babylonian myth may well have been the source for the ancient Israelite version.
 Other discoveries eventually turned up that contained portions of the Gilgamesh story. Now we have multiple versions from different periods of antiquity. The oldest are Sumerian tales that date all the way back to 2100 BCE. (The oldest strands of the book of Genesis were probably produced more than a full millennium later.
Note: 02

Enkidu mourns because he knows it will be he, and in expressing his grief he provides us with the earliest record in human history of the terror of death. He has a dream of being overwhelmed by a powerful man and recounts the nightmarish outcome in poignant terms:
 
 He seized me, drove me down to the dark house, dwelling of Erkalla’s god,
 To the house which those who enter cannot leave,
 On the road where travelling is one way only,

He decides he needs to find a path to immortality, and for that he needs advice. There is only one man in all of history who has escaped death to live life everlasting, a man named Ut-napishtim. Gilgamesh ventures on a journey to find him, to learn the secret of immortal existence.
Note: 04

Ut-napishtim is the Mesopotamian version of Noah, and, as already intimated, the tale of his involvement in the worldwide flood bears striking similarities to the later account of Genesis 6–9. The gods decide to destroy the human race with water, and Ut-napishtim is instructed to build an enormous boat, an acre in size, with seven levels. Once it is completed, he is to bring aboard his wife and specimens of
Note: 05

In that realm he first comes upon a mysterious woman identified simply as an “alewife.” It is not clear who she is or what she is doing there, but Gilgamesh is pleased to find a human of any sort and spills out to her the dreadful reason for his mission:
 
 I am afraid of Death, and so I roam open country…
 How, O how could I stay silent, how, O how could I keep quiet ?

Note: 06


 Ut-napishtim is speaking truth to terror: there is a limit to the days of life but no limit to the days of death.
 Gilgamesh asks Ut-napishtim why he is different, why he alone has been granted immortality, and it is that point that the immortal one tells his story of the flood. But even more important, he tells Gilgamesh that there is indeed a chance for him too to escape death, but through a different route.

 certain thorny plant that can restore him to his youth as an “antidote to the fear of death.”2 Ut-napishtim tells his intrepid seeker how to find it.
 And so Gilgamesh goes on another quest. With the boatman Ur-shanabi as a guide, he sails to the designated spot, ties stones to his feet, sinks to the bottom of the sea, and retrieves the plant of life, exclaiming:
 
 Ur-shanabi, this plant is a plant to cure a crisis!
 With it a man may win the breath of life…
 Its name shall be: “An old man grows into a young man.”
