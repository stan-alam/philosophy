## Notes on Exploring Bhagavad Gita

```text
This is potentially one of the most significant books to emerge in recent times on
how to read the G…t, for it provides a clear way forward to make coherent sense
of one of the most important yet methodologically intractable texts of religious
Hinduism. I found this book an illumining experience.

Religion and Fellow of Clare Hall, University of Cambridge, UK
A fascinating book which throws new light on the G…t, and should help to make it
more accessible to those who wish to read this great spiritual classic.

Church College, University of Oxford, UK
Ithamar Theodor approaches the ancient Bhavadad G…t with a modern mind and
finds much in it that deserves our attention. Locating his study within Comparative
Theology and identifying the various layers of meaning in the text will help those
unacquainted with it to find their way through this complex classic. Combining the
philosophical-theoretical with the ethical-practical the author shows the universal
relevance of the G…t’s teaching. Since Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan nobody has
offered as penetrating a study of this classic as Ithamar Theodor has done.
Klaus Klostermaier FRSC, Distinguished Professor of Hinduism and Religious
Studies Emeritus, University of Manitoba, Canada
