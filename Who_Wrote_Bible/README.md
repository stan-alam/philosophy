## groundbreaking new account of the writing of the Hebrew Bible
```ascii
Who wrote the Bible? Its books have no bylines. Tradition long identified Moses as the author of the Pentateuch, 
with Ezra as editor. Ancient readers also suggested that David wrote the psalms and Solomon wrote Proverbs and Qohelet. 
Although the Hebrew Bible rarely speaks of its authors, people have been fascinated by the question of its authorship 
since ancient times. In Who Really Wrote the Bible, William Schniedewind offers a bold new answer: the Bible was not 
written by a single author, or by a series of single authors, but by communities of scribes. The Bible does not name 
its authors because authorship itself was an idea enshrined in a later era by the ancient Greeks. In the 
pre-Hellenistic world of ancient Near Eastern literature, books were produced, preserved, and passed on by scribal communities.

Schniedewind draws on ancient inscriptions, archaeology, and anthropology, as well as a close reading of the 
biblical text itself, to trace the communal origin of biblical literature. Scribes were educated through apprenticeship 
rather than in schools. The prophet Isaiah, for example, has his “disciples”; Elisha has his “apprentice.” This mode of 
learning emphasized the need to pass along the traditions of a community of practice rather than to individuate and invent. 
Schniedewind shows that it is anachronistic to impose our ideas about individual authorship and authors on the writing of the Bible. 
Ancient Israelites didn’t live in books, he writes, but along dusty highways and byways. Who Really Wrote the Bible describes how 
scribes and their apprentices actually worked in ancient Jerusalem and Judah.
