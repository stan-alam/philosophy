## notes on From Akhenaten to Moses

```text
The shift from polytheism to monotheism changed the world radically. Akhenaten
and Moses ―a figure of history and a figure of tradition―symbolize this shift in
its incipient
, revolutionary stages and represent two civilizations that were brought into the
closest connection as early as the Book of Exodus, where Egypt stands for the old
world to be rejected and abandoned in order to enter the new one. The seven
chapters of this seminal study shed light on the great transformation from
different angles. Between Egypt in the first chapter and monotheism in the last,
five chapters deal in various ways with the transition from one to the other,
analyzing the Exodus myth, understanding the shift in terms of evolution and
revolution, confronting Akhenaten and Moses in a new way, discussing Karl
Jaspers’ theory of the Axial Age, and dealing with the eighteenth-century
view of the Egyptian mysteries as a cultural model.

Where does religious violence (violence committed in the name of God) come from? Its roots lie obviously in the polarizing power typical of monotheistic religions, dividing people into Jews and Gentiles, believers and non-believers, orthodox and heretics, and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Under the conditions of Ernstfall (case of emergency, i.e., war), people associate and dissociate in terms of friend and foe and are ready to annihilate each other with physical violence. Schmitt uses this dynamic as an argument for the hegemony of the political over all other spheres of culture, such as law, economy, science, art, morality, and religion, and pleads for the total state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The idea of an “apocalypse”—an imminent end and judgment of the world, separating humankind into friends and foes, saved and condemned, that arose at the same time as the first outbreaks of religious violence—exactly fulfills this condition of religious Ernstfall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This definition amounts to identifying Egyptian religion as a “primary” religion in contrast to “secondary religions,” which are defined as founded religions, all of which are eo ipso book religions and world religions.2 This definition of ancient Egyptian religion is of course very unspecific.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Even at this fundamental level, we should be prepared to meet huge differences among religions. There are some, among them the ancient Egyptian religion, where the cult holds the central and most prominent place; others, such as Christianity, have their center in theology; and still others, such as Judaism and Buddhism, are primarily concerned with questions of lifestyle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
