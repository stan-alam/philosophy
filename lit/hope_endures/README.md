I had to join as soon as possible. This was what I wanted to do. My friends were dumbfounded that I planned to throw away the chance to study medicine. We had all planned to go together to university in Sydney if we were lucky enough to get scholarships. My teachers and the rest of my family thought my decision was foolish. They felt that Mother Teresa’s sisters were poorly educated and did menial work. “You’re throwing your life away,” my uncle John remonstrated.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Sister John and I visited Vince, a gaunt man with a beard of gray stubble, who lived in such a room overlooking the tramline. We knew him because he had sometimes eaten at the shelter in Gore Street before he found his own room. Vince seldom shaved and his clothes were stiffened from dirt. The air in his room was heavy with the smell of stale urine and roll-your-own cigarettes. Sister showed me where to empty his night bucket into the common downstairs toilet, and then we began cleaning his room. We had to scrub down through the encrusted dirt to reveal the flower pattern and green color of the underlying linoleum.|

St. Ignatius himself, who had laid down this pattern of self-examination, was, at one stage in his life, so plagued by scruples that it nearly drove him to despair. The self-scrutiny caused an anxiety about motivation that otherwise would not have been present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
