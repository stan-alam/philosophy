I had to join as soon as possible. This was what I wanted to do. My friends were dumbfounded that I planned to throw away the chance to study medicine. We had all planned to go together to university in Sydney if we were lucky enough to get scholarships. My teachers and the rest of my family thought my decision was foolish.

Sister John and I visited Vince, a gaunt man with a beard of gray stubble, who lived in such a room overlooking the tramline. We knew him because he had sometimes eaten at the shelter in Gore Street before he found his own room. Vince seldom shaved and his clothes were stiffened from dirt. The air in his room was heavy with the smell of stale urine and roll-your-own cigarettes. Sister showed me where to empty his night bucket into the common downstairs toilet, and then we began cleaning his room. We had to scrub down through the encrusted dirt to reveal the flower pattern and green color of the underlying linoleum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

St. Ignatius himself, who had laid down this pattern of self-examination, was, at one stage in his life, so plagued by scruples that it nearly drove him to despair. The self-scrutiny caused an anxiety about motivation that otherwise would not have been present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

After Mass we had about a hundred to serve for morning tea. Then all the sisters in Melbourne came to share lunch, after which Sister Regina announced that Sister Rosa was assigned to Hanuabada, in Port Moresby, to join Sister Laboni; Sister Evelyn went to Bourke, where Elina was working; and Saranya went back to Katherine with Sister Christine. I sent a letter back with her to Naomi telling her all the news from Melbourne.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Three prisoners had escaped, and so the Nazis randomly selected ten men from the assembled inmates to die. A Polish sergeant who had been selected for execution cried out, “My poor wife and children!” At that, Kolbe stepped forward and volunteered to go to take his place.

Ancient spells were generally credited with giving shamans the ability to travel from one place to another in an instant and to have a watching eye everywhere, able to witness events without being present. Often these beliefs prevented the women from seeking medical help for themselves and their children, so deaths from treatable illnesses such as malaria were common. When we visited villages with our students as translators we tried to convince the parents to take their sick, malnourished children to the hospital clinic for medicine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

She told me later that the doctor said I was having seizures because of the large number of parasites interfering with blood flow to my brain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The novices were busy for weeks during recreation, packing buckets with canned fish, soap, rice, a towel, and other goods as they laughed and chatted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The sisters’ words of comfort left me feeling strangely hollow. “Well, she was very old, and now she’s with God. It’s silly to be sad. You should be happy. She’ll be in heaven looking out for you.” I felt empty and alone, wanting to be with Mum and Judy and the rest of my family to grieve our Gran.

Mother said this often enough, but the concepts seemed so alien to my way of thinking that I was slow to understand them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Mother, however, deliberately chose what was hard and penitential, which explained why she valued corporal penance and the silent acceptance of humiliation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

You see there is merit if in awareness of God you put up with the pain of undeserved punishment; but what glory is there in putting up with a beating after you have done something wrong? The merit in the sight of God is in putting up with it patiently when you are doing your duty. This in fact is what you were called to do because Christ suffered for you…. He was insulted and did not retaliate with insults; when he was suffering he made no threats but put his trust in the upright judge (1 Peter 2:18–                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The “divine command” that Saul disobeyed was an order to kill everything in the captured territories, “man and woman, babe and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey” (1 Samuel 15:3). Saul had spared some animals temporarily. He said that this was because he wanted to offer them as sacrifice. But God insisted through the prophet Samuel that He wanted absolute obedience, not sacrifice. Today, just as in biblical times, mindless, literal obedience to ancient religious commands presents a dangerous threat to the life and well-being of others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I forbid you to let these thoughts come again. If thoughts like this come, say, ‘Mother has forbidden me to think like this.’ It will be a source of pride for you. You will think, ‘My superior is angry, I am never angry.’ But you might do something just as displeasing to God that no one can see. Your face before God might be just as terrible as her angry face. Do not judge. You do not know how much she has struggled. One sister came here and lost her temper and then later she came crying with sorrow saying, ‘Mother at least ten times today I kept my temper.’ If you think like this, you must go to confession and say ‘I was disobedient and judgmental’; otherwise, these thoughts will simply break you. They will come between you and the love of God and you will end up leaving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Ask her to give you a heart so beautiful, so pure, so immaculate, a heart full of love and humility. You can become very holy where you are, but you must break off these thoughts. It is the devil coming to you as an angel of light. ‘How can you say to your brother, “Let me take that speck out of your eye,” while a plank remains in your own? You hypocrite! Remove the plank from your own eye first and then you will see clearly to take the speck from your brother’s eye’ [Matthew 7:4–5].” Mother then told me the story of a woman who had said she would rather have seen her daughter leave the convent in a coffin than to break her vows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

She went on to say we must never become “tip-top” or experts. We must not be ashamed of our low educational standards. The apostles were fishermen, the experts, and during the whole night they caught nothing. Then the carpenter told them to throw in the net and though everything was against it, they caught plenty. This may be the underlying reason why I was sent so inadequately prepared for my work in PNG and Manila. Mother wanted us to embrace poverty as she did because it bore witness to the true face of Jesus, poor, humble, and a friend of sinners, the weak and despised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

I also wanted us to take measures to keep contagion to a minimum, in other words, to keep those with active TB away from those without it, to isolate cases of gastroenteritis, measles, and other infectious diseases.

I called the morgue van and started washing the patients’ clothes and linen with the novices. Many of the patients were incontinent, but Mother considered a washing machine contrary to poverty. As usual, we said the Rosary aloud while doing the laundry, using brushes to remove the solid waste. I recited the words of the prayer, but my mind was elsewhere. Sometimes a poor person is sacred, I thought, Christ in His distressing disguise. At other times, he is just another powerless person we can treat as we please.

At least three times, even though you would think it impossible, the children lived. Once a very senior sister told me: “You have no faith. Why do you bother so much to save their lives? They are slum children. If they grow up, they may lead wicked lives. As long as they are baptised it is better that they die.” Jesus saved lives and had compassion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I had been in Hong Kong about six months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

She said God could fulfill His will using Pilate, Herod, or a Pharisee, if only I would lay down my life as Jesus did. She said that God was asking me to lay down my plans of becoming a doctor to be a simple handmaid of the Lord. She asked would I say “Yes, Lord.” They were all missing the point. I was not leaving to become a doctor, but if I left I had to do something, and medicine had always been my dream. I wrote to Mother on March 13, 1984. How are you, Mother? As you know, I left Bourke with your permission on January 9th, and you have given me until April 9th to come to a decision concerning my vows. It is already very clear to me that I should go ahead with my petition for a dispensation, as it seems impossible for me to continue to live the life of an MC. I have struggled for many years, and have only tried to persevere in this life because I thought leaving the Society would cut me off from God’s will for my life.

He was aghast. “How could you be old enough to go to school when they didn’t use calculators, and still be admitted to medicine?” Once we started clinical subjects, such as anatomy, physiology, and psychology, I did well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
