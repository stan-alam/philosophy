## notes on 'Beyond Biocentrism'

```text
In Beyond Biocentrism, acclaimed biologist Robert Lanza, one of TIME Magazine’s “100 Most
Influential People in 2014,” and leading astronomer Bob Berman, take the reader on an
intellectual thrill-ride as they re-examine everything we thought we knew about life,
death, the universe, and the nature of reality itself.

The first step is acknowledging that our existing model of reality is looking increasingly creaky
in the face of recent scientific discoveries. Science tells us with some precision that the universe
is 26.8 percent dark matter, 68.3 percent dark energy, and only 4.9 percent ordinary matter, but must
confess that it doesn’t really know what dark matter is and knows even less about dark energy. Science
is increasingly pointing toward an infinite universe but has no ability to explain what that really
means. Concepts such as time, space, and even causality are increasingly being demonstrated as
meaningless.

All of science is based on information passing through our consciousness but science hasn’t the
foggiest idea what consciousness is, and it can’t explain the linkage between subatomic states and
observation by conscious observers. Science describes life as an random occurrence in a dead
universe but has no real understanding of how life began or why the universe appears to be
exquisitely designed for the emergence of life.

The biocentrism theory isn’t a rejection of science. Quite the opposite. Biocentrism challenges us to
fully accept the implications of the latest scientific findings in fields ranging from plant
biology and cosmology to quantum entanglement and consciousness.

By listening to what the science is telling us, it becomes increasingly clear that life and
consciousness are fundamental to any true understanding of the universe. This forces a
fundamental rethinking of everything we thought we knew about life, death, and our
place in the universe.
