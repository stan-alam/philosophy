 Malachi Mulligan to Stephen Dedalus:
 
 — God, he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a grey sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. Epi oinopa ponton. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks. I must teach you. You must read them in the original. Thalatta! Thalatta! She is our great sweet mother. Come and look.

Which is the best of Shakespeare’s plays? I mean in what mood and with what accompaniment do you like the sea best?
 JOHN KEATS, LETTER TO JANE REYNOLDS, SEPTEMBER 14, 1817
 
 Here lies one whose name is writ in water.
 
 EPITAPH OF JOHN KEATS


Sándor Ferenczi’s Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality (1924). That remarkable book expanded Freudian psychoanalytic theory in the direction of what Ferenczi called bioanalysis. I was gripped by the main theme of bioanalysis, 

Ferenczi called “the thalassic regressive undertow.” By that he meant that the sea, celebrated by poets and scientists alike as the original site and source of life, eventually draws all life back to itself. All that lives ends by drowning, as it were, in what Hegel called “the universal element.” Ferenczi also reflected on the way in which the gestation of the mammalian

fetus in amniotic fluid, the saline solution in which we humans too spend our initial months, can be understood in phylogenetic terms as the need to find an ersatz for the sea. 

1920 called “the destruction-and-death drives,” Ferenczi added, may be interpreted as the sea’s imperious summons to return whence we came.

. In later years I came to appreciate what Herman Melville meant when he said that meditation and water are “wedded for ever.”


Merleau-Ponty, Levinas, and Derrida among them—have stressed the importance of such passivity, however. In this they may have been following the lead of Heidegger’s Being and Time, which emphasizes that existence is “moved” rather than self-moving: Bewegtheit, rather than Bewegung, is the guiding concept of fundamental ontology.
 My own meditation on the sea reflects this passivity, but also my resistance to it, a resistance that takes the form of research and analysis. Yet no amount of strategic reading or painstaking research and analysis can explain precisely why the thinkers and writers who appear in my book are the only ones who appear 

. No amount of research or scholarly discipline can alter very much the way these choices go. They follow submarine currents and undertows. All I can hope is that the works that have chosen me in this encounter with the sea prove to be rich resources for my readers as well.

Philosophers have increasingly abandoned the sea to marine biologists, adventurers, and poets, preferring the security and the logic of the lee shore. Poets, occasionally joined by psychoanalysts, take us back to the sources, however; that is, to the sources that feed the sea, the sea that evaporates to cloud, the cloud that releases rainfall, and the stream that rushes to the sea, the source of all sources.

The legends of well-nigh all the ancient peoples report that humankind came from the water and that the soul is a puff of air. Remarkably, science has determined that the human body consists almost entirely of water. One is reduced in size. Having got off the train, by which they had crossed through the compact network of European energies, and still jumpy from the motion that had hustled them along, the 

 siblings stood before the tranquillity of sea and sky not otherwise than they would have stood a hundred thousand years ago. Ag[athe’s] eyes welled up, and A[nders] bowed his head.
 ROBERT MUSIL, NACHLASS


Numberless songs hail “the seven seas,” but there is only one sea, or at least only one source of the sea. The Greeks called it Ὠκεανός. They thought of it as a vast river, but whether river or sea Okeanos courses without interruption about the Earth.

Leukothea,



Humankind has a profound and complex relationship with the sea, a relationship that is extensively reflected in biology, psychology, religion, literature and poetry. The sea cradles and soothes us, we visit it often for solace and inspiration, it is familiar, being the place where life ultimately began. Yet the sea is also dark and mysterious and often spells catastrophe and death. The sea is a set of contradictions: kind, cruel, indifferent. She is a blind will that will 'have her way'. In exploring this most capricious of phenomena, David Farrell Krell engages the work of an array of thinkers and writers including, but not limited to, Homer, Thales, Anaximander, Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, H?lderlin, Melville, Woolf, Whitman, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Schelling, Ferenczi, Rank and Freud.

The Sea explores the significance in Western civilization of the catastrophic and generative power of the sea and what humankind's complex relationship with it reveals about the human condition, human consciousness, temporality, striving, anxiety, happiness and mortality.
