## notes on Epicurus, Travels. 

```text
After being advised by his dentist to get tooth implants, Daniel Klein decides to stick
with his dentures and instead use the money to make a trip to the Greek island Hydra and
discover the secrets of aging happily. Drawing on the inspiring lives of his Greek friends
and philosophers ranging from Epicurus to Sartre, Klein uncovers the simple pleasures that
are available late in life, as well as the refined pleasures that only a mature mind can
fully appreciate.

A travel book, a witty and accessible meditation, and an optimistic guide to living well,
Travels with Epicurus is a delightful jaunt to the Aegean and through the terrain of old
age that only a free spirit like Klein could lead.

Following a trip to his dentist, 73-year-old Klein considers his options after being advised
that he needs tooth implants or a denture. Klein (Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar) opts for a
sojourn to the Greek island of Hydra. Accompanied by a suitcase crammed with philosophy books, Klein
contemplates the Greek philosopher Epicurus’ pivotal question. He fundamentally wanted to know how to
make the most of his one life, writes Klein. Eschewing the forever young treadmill many American’s embrace,
Klein explores a different path, examining the relaxed Greek lifestyle surrounding him. He laments what’s
lost in the frantic rush to stay youthful: And we have no time left for a calm and reflective appreciation
of our twilight years, no deliciously long afternoons sitting with friends or listening to music or musing
about the story of our lives. The author ruminates on the benefits of freeing ourselves from the prison of
everyday affairs; the pleasures of companionship in old age; battling boredom; the difference between sexual
urges and sexual nostalgia; and the value of facing death blissfully. Along the way, Klein touches on the
ideas of Bertrand Russell, Erik Erikson, Aristotle, and William James. Klein’s narrative is a delightful
and spirited conversation, offering up the ingredients inherent to the art of living well in old age. ~ Booklist
