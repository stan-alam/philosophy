## notes on existential "survival" guide

```text
Soren Kierkegaard, Frederick Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and other towering figures
of existentialism grasped that human beings are, at heart, moody creatures, susceptible
to an array of psychological setbacks, crises of faith, flights of fancy, and other
emotional ups and downs. Rather than understanding moods—good and bad alike—as afflictions
to be treated with pharmaceuticals, this swashbuckling group of thinkers generally known as
existentialists believed that such feelings not only offer enduring lessons about living a
life of integrity, but also help us discern an inner spark that can inspire spiritual development
and personal transformation. To listen to Kierkegaard and company, how we grapple with these
feelings shapes who we are, how we act, and, ultimately, the kind of lives we lead.

In The Existentialist’s Survival Guide, Gordon Marino, director of the Hong Kierkegaard
Library at St. Olaf College and boxing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, recasts
the practical takeaways existentialism offers for the twenty-first century. From negotiating
angst, depression, despair, and death to practicing faith, morality, and love, Marino
dispenses wisdom on how to face existence head-on while keeping our hearts intact, especially
when the universe feels like it’s working against us and nothing seems to matter.
