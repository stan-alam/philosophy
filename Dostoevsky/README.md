## Fyodor Dostoevsky

```text
".Hence the large scale of Dostoevsky’s characters, their way of emerging from
the book—so much so that commentators have often argued or agreed with them as
if they were quite independent of their author. They are not representative
social types or individuals but inwardly free persons."
