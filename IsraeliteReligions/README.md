**notes on Israelite Religion**

```ascii
Archaeological excavation in the Holy Land has exploded with the resurgence of interest in the historical roots 
of the biblical Israelites. Israelite Religions offers Bible students and interested lay leaders a survey of the 
major issues and approaches that constitute the study of ancient Israelite religion. Unique among other books on 
the subject, Israelite Religions takes the Bible seriously as a historical source, balancing the biblical material 
with relevant evidence from archaeological finds.
