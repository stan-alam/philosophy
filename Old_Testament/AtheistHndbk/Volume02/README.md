Praise for "The Atheist Handbook to the Old Testament, Volume Two":

The chapters detailing the conquest of Canaan and the Exodus from Egypt accurately summarize the current state of our knowledge and beliefs, and are written in an accessible and understandable way, making them an excellent resource for people who are interested in learning more about how the biblical narrative relates to our knowledge of ancient history. I would not hesitate to assign both chapters to my own students.

Joshua Bowen’s The Atheist Handbook to the Old Testament Volume Two will appeal to atheists and those of faith alike for its insightful examination of Scripture’s most problematic passages. Bowen’s approach to the topic is refreshing, for he encourages a respectful debate between atheists and believers over the historicity of the biblical narratives. In this book, Bowen presents an authoritative critique of Scripture’s historical and ethical claims based on the best and most recent scholarship, with a particular focus on textual and archaeological discoveries. He convincingly shows why a civil society cannot base its ethics on the ancient biblical texts.
