Buseyisms


 I’ve spent decades constructing “Buseyisms.” What is a Buseyism? you ask. I create a deeper, more dimensional meaning for a word using the letters that spell it. For example, FART (a fan favorite): Feeling A Rectal Transmission. Another popular Buseyism is FUN: Finally Understanding Nothing. The Buseyism I cherish most is NUTS: Never Underestimate

 The Spirit. Many have said that my Buseyisms are insightful, motivational, and funny. The question often comes up: “Gary, when are you going to write a book with all your Buseyisms?

 Living On Victorious Energy

Mom moved the latch higher on the front door, but I still found a way to unlock it with a broomstick. Nothing could stop me from visiting those dogs. My mom and aunts all claimed, “We can’t stop Gary. He goes where he wants to, and that’s it.” I was evolving into a real force of nature.

When I saw The Thing with my best friend, Ronnie Dale, I remember we were so scared, we moved all the way back to share the very last seat in the theater in case we had to make a run for it.


Watching Samson and Delilah moved me so deeply, it was like lightning struck my artistic heart in a way that gave me the freedom and desire to express myself.


They go off and make another picture show for us to see.”
 “Hmm.” I thought about that concept for a moment, then announced, “That’s what I want to do.”
 “Oh, you want to be in the picture show?”
 “I want to tell stories with light.”

I, on the other hand, was always loud, fast, and carefree, never thinking before I spoke and always doing something to be noticed. Growing up, my interests were very simple; in fact, I really had only one—football.


In the ninth grade, I tried out for the team again with high hopes and a strong will. I made it! I was given the position of starting center. During the year I was on the team, I learned great new techniques that made me

I was astonished at how comfortable I felt with the theater folk. They were a creative and kind group. The way the rehearsal process worked was fascinating—one scene or one musical number at a time, then blocking, props, costumes, finally putting everything together. Acting was the antithesis of football. I was gardening in a new oasis of expressive freedom that I had never been in before. I loved it.


Hey, there he is.” It was my first taste of being recognized not just for being me but for something I did onstage that people loved and applauded.

Hearing people laugh at me was sheer joy. The acceptance I received onstage went forever to my heart. That night, the theater made its way into my blood. This was more than simply a dare; it was angelic intervention.

A friend in the Sigma Chi house suggested, “How about the Rubber Band?” That sounded good to us, so we became the Rubber Band.

Being Native American, Dad never spoke much, but when he did, his words were very poignant. So far in my life, he had taught me two simple lessons: “Boys don’t cry,” and “Can’t never did do nothing.” I lived by those lessons, and they had been very helpful to me growing up. I waited for Dad to reply, but he didn’t stop what he was doing or look up at me. He forcefully thrust his shovel in the ground and finally said, “You can do anything you want to do.” Then he took a long pause and said, “And if you want it done right, do it yourself.” He carefully placed the new tree in the hole he’d dug and covered the roots with dirt. Dad never looked at me.

They wore bell-bottom pants, wide belts, paisley shirts with psychedelic colors, necklaces with peace signs, and round rose-colored glasses.

We stood out like farm animals.
 Determined to get the Rubber Band a record deal, I had a list of ten managers in my pocket. One by one, we got rejected by all of them—except for the last guy, Buddy Resnik. Buddy had a personal management company in Beverly Hills called National Talent Consultants. He was big-time; he represented actress Nichelle Nichols on a new show called Star Trek and an Irish band called Them with Van Morrison, who had the hit “Gloria” on the radio.

 For the next year, back in Oklahoma, all I heard on the radio was “Light My Fire” by the Doors. They were pretty out there on psychedelic flavors, but the song grew on me. It reminded me that I really belonged in California. I told Glen, “We weren’t on the wrong trail ride after all. I just didn’t recognize the cows.”
