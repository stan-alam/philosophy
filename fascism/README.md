## notes on fascism

```text
A Fascist, observes Madeleine Albright, “is someone who claims to speak for a whole nation or group,
is utterly unconcerned with the rights of others, and is willing to use violence and whatever other means
are necessary to achieve the goals he or she might have.”

The twentieth century was defined by the clash between democracy and Fascism, a struggle that created
uncertainty about the survival of human freedom and left millions dead. Given the horrors of that
experience, one might expect the world to reject the spiritual successors to Hitler and Mussolini
should they arise in our era. In Fascism: A Warning, Madeleine Albright draws on her experiences
as a child in war-torn Europe and her distinguished career as a diplomat to question that assumption.

Fascism, as she shows, not only endured through the twentieth century but now presents a more
virulent threat to peace and justice than at any time since the end of World War II.  
The momentum toward democracy that swept the world when the Berlin Wall fell has gone
into reverse.  The United States, which historically championed the free world, is
led by a president who exacerbates division and heaps scorn on democratic institutions.  
In many countries, economic, technological, and cultural factors are weakening the
political center and empowering the extremes of right and left.  Contemporary
leaders such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un are employing many of the tactics
used by Fascists in the 1920s and 30s
