## notes on 'Neuroexistentialism: Meaning, Morals, ...'
```text
Existentialisms arise when the foundations of being, such as meaning, morals, and
purpose come under assault. In the first-wave of existentialism, writings typified
by Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche concerned the increasingly apparent inability
of religion, and religious tradition, to support a foundation of being. Second-wave
existentialism, personified philosophically by Sartre, Camus, and de Beauvoir, developed
in response to similar realizations about the overly optimistic Enlightenment vision of reason and the common good.

The third-wave of existentialism, a new existentialism, developed in response to advances
in the neurosciences that threaten the last vestiges of an immaterial soul or self. Given
the increasing explanatory and therapeutic power of neuroscience, the mind no longer
stands apart from the world to serve as a foundation of meaning. This produces foundational
anxiety.

In Neuroexistentialism, a group of contributors that includes some of the world's
leading philosophers, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and legal scholars,
explores the anxiety caused by third-wave existentialism and possible responses to it.
Together, these essays tackle our neuroexistentialist predicament, and explore what
the mind sciences can tell us about morality, love, emotion, autonomy, consciousness,
selfhood, free will, moral responsibility, law, the nature of criminal punishment,
meaning in life, and purpose.

"There's been lots of grounds for existential dread. First, God died in Nietzsche's arms.
Then, the 20th century nearly drowned us in human carnage. Now, we are beset with what Caruso
and Flanagan call the "third wave" of existential despair--what do we do as neuroscience shows
that "mind" is solely a product of "brain," that "brain" is solely a product of an indifferent
physical universe, and that free will is a myth? In this superb volume, some of the smartest
people on earth wrestle with the implications of neuroexistentialism, including with the
deepest question of all - how do we find meaning if we are merely the sum of our biology?"
--Robert M. Sapolsky, Professor of Neuroscience, Stanford University


"This book brings together leading neuroscientists and philosophers to examine concepts
such as free will, love, and morality through the lens of modern brain research, and will
be indispensable to scholars interested in what neuroscience can tell us about human nature
and selfhood." --Mo Costandi, Neurophilosophy blog, The Guardian, and author of
Neuroplasticity (2016)


"Philosophy is indispensable in the effort to sort out the complexities of nature,
especially human nature. The ability of the human brain to envision future existence
gives us great advantages in planning our lives, but also allows us to worry, to be
anxious about the future. The essays in Neuroexistentialism by leading philosophers and
scientists offer fascinating perspectives on the human search for meaning at the present
time, the age of the brain." --Joseph E. LeDoux, neuroscientist and author of Anxious:
Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety (2015).


"A splendid collection of papers that address (unflinchingly and from a variety of perspectives)
anxieties - personal, social, and political - unleashed by recent advances in neuroscience that
appear to undermine agency, responsibility, and human dignity...The book will serve as an
indispensable resource for specialists and nonspecialists alike." --John Heil,
Washington University in St. Louis and Monash University

The Death of the Soul
The  naturalization  of  human  nature  proceeds  apace,  
driven by science, in particular neuroscience as it maps
the  brain  processes  that  mediate  choice  and  behav-
ior. Where the soul once presided, there are, it turns
out, only neurons in fantastically complex structures
which somehow maintain the coherent psychological
and  behavioral  pattern  –  character,  beliefs,  desires  –  
that constitutes each of us as a person. The feeling of
being a singular self that owns these characteristics is
real enough, but there’s no indivisible thing to which
that feeling refers. Rather, it’s the result of a subset of
neural  goings-on  tasked  with  reliably  distinguishing  
the physical person from the rest of the world, all in
service to effective action. For reasons under investi-
gation by neuroscientists and philosophers, doing that
job somehow produces the subjective sense of me be-
ing me, of you being you.
Besides killing off the soul, the scientific story of how
each  of  us  ends  up  exactly  
this
  person  seems  to  ex-
plode the idea of any act of ultimate self-creation, of
any  departure  from  law-like  cause  and  effect  as  the  
individual takes shape. If so, we can’t take or assign the
sort of credit or blame for character and behavior that
supposes  we  could  have  turned  out  and  acted  other-
wise  as  our  lives  unfolded.  Add  some  randomness  if  
you like, so that things might have turned out differ-
ently (although they didn’t), but it isn’t clear how that
confers more self-responsibility (although some think
it does, see below).
Something  like  this  deflationary  picture  prompted  
dear  departed  Tom  Wolfe  to  write  an  entertaining  
1997 essay,
Sorry, but your soul just died,
 on the anxi-
eties about human agency generated by genetics, neu-
roscience,  and  determinism.  In  
Neuroexistentialism
,
editors Gregg Caruso and Owen Flanagan present a
nicely varied and decidedly naturalistic set of respons-
es to the same set of worries 20 years on. In seeking
some  sort  of  post-soul  equilibrium,  no  supernatural  
hypotheses or claims are made anywhere in this col-
lection;  the  authors  all  agree  that  empirical  science,  
kept honest by philosophy, should arbitrate questions
of what exists, all of which is within nature. Despite
this  common  ground,  they  sometimes  diverge  sub-
stantially on what the naturalization of agency means,
or  should  mean,  for  us  neurally-instantiated  selves.  
Is there any room for ultimate self-construction, and
thus  for  deep,  ultimate  responsibility?  If  not,  what  
impact might this have on our interpersonal attitudes,
our  concepts  of  authenticity,  control,  and  moral  re-
sponsibility, and on criminal justice policy? Most ba-
sically, how, without recourse to the supernatural, can
we come to terms with the scientific picture of who
we  are?  (Wolfe  ends  his  article  suggesting  we  can’t  
help but re-inject God.) This volume presents a wide
range  of  enlightening  interdisciplinary  perspectives  
from scientists and philosophers on discovering our-
selves to be fully natural, physical creatures.

The Third Wave
The introduction by Caruso and Flanagan motivates
the  collection  by  locating  
neuro
existentialism  as  the  
third wave in the historical rise of existentialism, con-
ceived  of  as  responses  to  the  threat  of  nihilism.  The  
first  wave  was  driven  by  the  challenge  to  religion:  if  
we  doubt  God  and  divine  purposes,  from  whence  
meaning and morality? The Enlightenment purport-
edly  came  to  the  rescue  in  its  appeal  to  human  sol-
idarity  and  reason:  we  can  build  a  meaningful  and  
moral earthly paradise, or something close enough, by
nurturing  our  better  natures.  Sadly,  this  hasn’t  quite  
panned  out,  hence  the  second  existentialist  wave,  
exemplified  by  Sartre  and  Camus,  who  produced  a  
strongly  individualist  response  to  the  horrors  of  20
th
century war: there is no salvation either in heaven or
on Earth; the only honest stance is to face the fact of
our  radical  freedom  in  an  absurd  universe.  But,  ac-
cording  to  neuroscience  and  other  sciences  bearing  
on  human  behavior,  we  are  not  radically  free,  so  the  
Sartrean prescription doesn’t work either. Neuroexis-
tentialism,  the  third  wave,  can  thus  be  characterized  
as  a  response  to  the  ever  more  explicit  realization  
that physicalism and determinism hold in the human
person, however complex our mental and social lives
might be. (Again, feel free to add some indetermin-
ism and see where it gets you morally or practically.)
What, then, are we to make of our situation and our-
selves  as  the  mechanisms  of  mind  and  behavior  are  
laid bare? How do we cope with the death of the soul?
Morality Naturalized
For one thing, science can explain why we are moral
animals,  moral  to  such  an  extent  that  no  amount  of  
science will end up debunking our hard-wired intui-
tions about ethics. Chapters by philosophers Patricia
Churchland  and Maureen Sei delve into the neuro-
science of altruism, cooperation and affection, driving
home  the  point  that  our  virtuous  inclinations,  since  
biologically  installed,  don’t  need  the  top-down  en-
dorsement of a higher power to have hold on us. We
can be and often are good without God, and without
any  non-physical  homunculus  calling  the  shots.  The  
very  worry  about  moral  foundations  is  testament  to  
the reality of our moral natures, so learning they are
modulated by such humble (or is it noble?) chemicals
as  oxytocin  and  vasopressin  isn’t  likely  to  render  us  
morally  incapacitated.  Relatedly,  philosophers  Paul  
Henne  and  Walter  Sinnott-Armstrong  consider  the  
possibly corrosive effects of neuroscience on morality,
and  reassure  us  that  even  though  the  literature  sug-
gests we are sometimes mistaken in our moral judg-
ments, there’s no good reason to think we are always
deceived  in  making  them.  Their  paper  is  a  model  of  
careful  philosophical  argumentation  in  light  of  the  
experimental  science  of  belief-formation.  Neurosci-
entist Edmund Rolls considers the genetically trans-
mitted neuro-behavioral roots of our moral sense, and
again finds a robust biological basis for both our intu-
itive ethics and our talent for constructing systems of
rights and responsibilities. So even though evolution
didn’t have culture in mind, we needn’t be more than
evolved  creatures  to  suppose  that  our  socially-medi-
ated  moral  practices,  albeit  improvable,  at  least  have  
prima facie
validity given the sorts of creatures we are.
That said, in his essay philosopher Jesse Prinz points
out  that  although  our  values  often  seem  indisputa-
ble and timeless, they are in fact contingent products
of  culture  and  biology.  We  don’t  choose  them  from  
a radically free Sartrean standpoint, so we necessari-
ly operate in terms of some pre-existing values when
undertaking  the  project  of  moral  improvement.  But  
which  ones  should  guide  us?  Prinz  recommends  we  
use science to test whether the factual claims used to
buttress suspect moral claims are true (e.g., that rac-
ism and sexism are warranted), and if they aren’t, we’ll
have at least narrowed down the options when seek-
ing common ground.
Can Libertarian Free Will be Naturalized?
Morality,  then,  survives  the  neuroexistentialist  chal-
lenge, even if political and tribal disputes about how
values  should  be  prioritized  won’t  ever  go  away  (see  
for  example  Jonathan  Haidt’s  work  on  how  liberals  
and  conservatives  differ  in  their  moral  foundations).  
A more vulnerable target, however, receives the lion’s
share of attention in this book: the (purportedly) free-
ly-willing,  rational,  autonomous  and  authentic  self,  
the responsible originator of action that traditionally
has been understood to stand at least a little apart or
above the natural world – a little god, so to speak. All
but one of the contributors (neuroscientist Peter Tse)
would  agree  that  we  don’t  have  libertarian  or  con-
tra-causal free will – the freedom that would make us
a  more  responsible  originator  than  were  our  choices  
and actions fully determined by the circumstances in
play  in  actual  situations.  That  is,  they’d  say  
in
deter-
minism,  should  it  exist  at  the  micro  or  macro  level  
(and  it  might),  wouldn’t  help  make  us  more  free  or

responsible. So for all practical purposes they present
themselves  as  naturalist  determinists.  How  well  do  
choice and agency fare under determinism?
Not  that  badly  it  turns  out,  but  some  readers  may  
have to re-calibrate or re-think their criteria for what
counts  as  an  authentic  choice  if  we  don’t  evade  de-
terminism. For those who won’t or can’t let go of the
libertarian chooser, Peter Tse offers a neuro-biological
hypothesis supporting the idea that we are, in fact, not
completely  embedded  in  a  cause-and-effect  world.  
Naturalism, he says, still allows us to contribute some-
thing  to  a  choice  that  is  neither  fully  determined  by  
antecedent conditions, nor merely random; we really
and truly could have done otherwise in an actual situ-
ation (even though we didn’t) in a way that’s ultimate-
ly up to us, not chance. But despite his patient exege-
sis, how quantum indeterminacy defeats determinism
without  attenuating  agency,  and  how  indeterminacy  
actually
adds
 to an agent’s responsibility for behavior,
remain  obscure  to  me  (and  I  suspect  most  natural-
ists,  since  few  have  signed  on  to  his  libertarianism).  
Until  we  have  a  clear  account  of  the  mechanisms  of  
contra-causal  choice  (a  contradiction  in  terms?)  and  
solid evidence that the brain actually instantiates such
mechanisms, it seems to me unwise to claim we likely
are libertarian agents. As a matter of epistemic probity
and moral prudence we should stick with what seems
a good deal more probable: that even if it sometimes
breaks  causal  chains,  indeterminism  can’t  add  to  our  
power, control or responsibility.
Authenticity at Risk
If  it  doesn’t,  then  in  developing  naturalized  concep-
tions  of  agency  we  must,  as  do  the  rest  of  the  con-
tributors,  work  within  determinism  and  without  the  
ultimate  sort  of  responsibility  that  libertarians  want.  
Philosopher Neil Levy shows just how wrong Sartre
was  in  his  claim  of  radical  freedom,  and  in  the  pro-
cess raises the specter of radical skepticism concern-
ing the true, authentic self that freely and consciously
chooses  its  values:  “...cognitive  science  threatens  to  
dissolve the self and thereby the very agent who was
supposed to do the choosing.” (114)  Since we are not
unitary, but rather a multiplicity of neurally- instan-
tiated  mental  modules  cobbled  together  by  evolu-
tion, we don’t have anything approaching transparent
conscious  access  to  all  the  influences  that  ultimately  
shape  us  and  our  choices.  However,  Levy  suggests  
that  the  explicit  realization  that  we  are  
not
  self-om-
niscient is exactly what’s needed to make a good stab
at  a  realistic  authenticity.  Still,  we  might  miss:  “We  
must  recognize  that  we  can  never  be  confident  that  
our most important choices were not influenced deci-
sively by facts we cannot endorse or that the reasons
we entertain are the reasons for which we act.” Never
completely confident perhaps, but nevertheless capa-
ble  of  checking  how  our  behavior  might  reflect  the  
nefarious influence of an unconscious module.
A  somewhat  more  reassuring  version  of  existential-
ist  authenticity  is  offered  by  philosophers  Shaun  
Gallagher, Ben Morgan and Naomi Rokotnitz. Like
Levy, they mount a strong critique of Sartrean radical
autonomy, but replace it with a relational, interperson-
al understanding of how selves grow and thrive. They
apply the “4E” theory of consciousness and cognition
– that we are embodied (not just a brain), embedded
in a physical and social environment,
enactive (envi-
ronmentally  responsive  when  engaged  in  cognition,  
not manipulators of internal mental representations)
and
extended  (our  embodied  minds  interpenetrate  
with the world) – in support of the claim that we are
essentially relational creatures. If so, then we are most
authentically ourselves in accepting our “primary in-
tersubjectivity” in communion with others. Whether
or not one buys the 4E theory (neural representation
seems  pretty  indispensable  in  thinking  about  brain-
based cognition), they’re correct that we don’t face the
problems of meaning and value commitments alone,
which arguably makes them a good deal more tracta-
ble. I find that the problem of meaning often disap-
pears during a good dinner party.
Conservative or Revisionist?
One way to categorize these essays is along a conserv-
ative-revisionist  dimension:  how  much  changes,  or  
should change, in our agency-related beliefs, attitudes
and  policies  under  pressure  from  what  philosopher  
Eddy  Nahmias  calls  “neuronaturalism”?  Is  a  revolu-
tion in order, or not, given the realization that “...all
the mental processes involved in making your choice
[are]...a complex set of neural processes which caus-
ally interact in accord with the laws of nature”? (252)
Nahmias  –  a  compatibilist  about  free  will  (free  will  
is  declared  compatible  with  determinism,  or  at  least  
with our not being libertarian agents) – is somewhat
on the conservative side of the spectrum. Although he
enjoins us to accept neuronaturalism, he doesn’t think
it  requires  giving  up  “most  of  our  cherished  beliefs  
Science, Religion & Culture
2018 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | Page 48     
about  ourselves.”  (253)    This  is  because  he  foresees,  
based  on  research  he  and  others  have  conducted  on  
beliefs about free will, that folks will be comfortable
with  the  idea  that  explanations  of  choices  in  terms  
of beliefs, desires and intentions are compatible with
non-dualism,  the  thesis  that  we  don’t  have  souls  as  
well as bodies (basically, brains-r-us). He says “...we
should  predict  that  people  are  not  committed  to  a  
dualist understanding of free will that conflicts with
neuronaturalism.” (258)  Bets, anyone? More research
is needed, but isn’t one cherished belief widely held in
our rather religious culture the dualist notion of “soul
control”:  that  we  are  more  than  material  creatures,  
and that therefore we could have done otherwise in a
situation, even given all the causes in play? Whatever
the case, Nahmias does a great anti-reductionist job in
explaining how psychological explanations have their
own  autonomous  explanatory  role,  even  if  mental  
processes are completely physical in their realization.
And he makes the crucial point that even under de-
terminism agents can be considered causal sources of
action (what I’ve come to call agent determinism). He
also  has  interesting  things  to  say  about  moral  desert  
which I’ll cover below.
Another sanguine, conservative-tending compatibilist
is Michael Gazzaniga, one of the deans of (split) brain
research. He makes no bones about determinism, but
like  Nahmias  resists  the  sort  of  neuro-reductionism  
that  seems  to  some  to  undermine  the  causal  role  of  
conscious  decision-making  in  behavior.  He  quotes  
approvingly  neuroscientist  Roger  Sperry  from  way  
back in 1966:
...when it comes to brains, remember always that
the simpler, electric, atomic, molecular and cellu-
lar forces and laws, though still present and oper-
ating, have all been superseded in brain dynam-
ics  by  the  configurational  forces  of  higher-level  
mechanisms.  At  the  top,  in  the  human  brain,  
these  include  the  powers  of  perception,  cogni-
tion,  memory,  reason,  judgment,  and  the  like,  
the operational, causal effects of forces which are
equally  or  more  potent  in  brain  dynamics  than  
are the out-classed inner chemical forces...
If we cannot avoid determinism, accept and work
with  it.  There  may  be  worse  “fates”  than  causal  
determinism.  Maybe,  after  all,  it  is  better  to  be  
properly  imbedded  in  the  causal  flow  of  cosmic  
forces, as an integral part thereof, than to be on
the  loose  and  out  of  contact,  free-floating,  as  it  
were,  with  behavioral  possibilities  that  have  no  
antecedent cause and hence no reason or any re-
liability for future plans or predictions. (225)
In light of all this (total music to my ears), Gazzina-
ga locates personal responsibility not in brains but in
our social practices of
holding
 each other responsible
as  reasons-responsive  creatures.  This  seems  reasona-
ble  enough.  But  if  we  accept  that  “human  behavior  
is the product of a determined system that is guided
by  experience,”  might  that  have  implications  for  our  
responsibility
practices
? Gazzaniga doesn’t address this
question, so by omission ends up on the conservative
side, at least compared to some others here.
Philosopher Walter Glannon’s contribution also takes
aim  at  neuro-reductionism  (more  broadly,  reductive  
materialism),  but  despite  his  non-dualist  protesta-
tions  it  ends  up  verging  on  mind-brain  dualism.  To  
wit: “The phenomenology of what it is like to visual-
ize one’s own brain activity and modulate it...cannot
be explained entirely in materialist terms... the mind
can induce changes in the brain and have a causal role
in...control.”  (156)    And,  in  describing  mental  acts  
of  self-control  (as  in  resisting  the  behavioral  tics  of  
Tourette’s syndrome) he says these have “a phenome-
nological aspect that cannot be captured by appeal to
brain  processes  alone.  Although  their  effects  may  be  
limited,  through  these  acts  of  will,  some  people  can  
expand  the  space  of  agency  beyond  what  normal  or  
abnormal  neurobiology  has  given  them.”  (158)  That  
human  agency  ever  transcends  neurobiology  seems  
doubtful, and the claim that it could potentially leaves
room  for  libertarian  free  will  and  its  moral  hazards  
(see below). Glannon doesn’t discuss the practical im-
plications of his view, which could lead one to suspect
he sees no reason to rock the boat of our current re-
sponsibility practices.
Determinism and Desert
The conservative-revisionist debate really gets going in
the essays focused on moral responsibility and crimi-
nal justice policy. Are offenders morally responsible in
what’s come to be called the “basic desert” sense, and
therefore  deserving  of  retributive  punishment,  pun-
ishment  that  need  not  be  justified  by  producing  any  
good  consequences  (e.g.,  moral  reform,  deterrence,  
public  safety)?  The  revisionists  (of  various  strengths)  
include philosophers Caruso, Derk Pereboom, Valerie
Science, Religion & Culture
2018 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | Page 49     
Hardcastle,  and  Farah  Focquaert,  psychologist  An-
drea  Glenn,  and  criminologist  Adrian  Raine.  They  
take  the  position,  more  or  less,  as  put  by  Focquaert,  
Glenn,  and  Raine,  that  “The  kind  of  free  will  that  
would justify moral responsibility in the basic desert
sense  is  scientifically  questionable  and  justifying  de-
sert-based moral responsibility on the mere possibili-
ty of such free will is normatively questionable.” (240)  
The question then arises: “Can retribution be morally
justified if we live in a world in which all human be-
havior  is  the  result  of  the  complex  interplay  among  
genes,  the  environment,  and  (potentially)  some  add-
ed  randomness?”  (240)  The  revisionist  answer  is  no,  
it can’t. Determinism undermines desert by showing
that offenders couldn’t have turned out or done oth-
erwise  given  all  the  causes  in  play,  and  any  random-
ness can’t add to responsibility. This conclusion entails
a  substantial  rethinking  of  our  criminal  justice  prac-
tices, which at least in the U.S. hinge a great deal on
the  notion  that  offenders  deserve  retribution  of  the  
sort  which  justifies  making  their  lives  miserable  (or  
sometimes  killing  them),  whatever  else  the  aims  of  
punishment might be.
The  revisionists  –  skeptics  about  basic  desert,  if  not  
about all brands of free will and moral responsibility
–  endorse  a  variety  of  proposals  for  criminal  justice  
reform to make it a forward-looking, consequentialist
system which abandons the infliction of suffering for
its  own,  deserved  sake.  Even  if  we’re  not  libertarian  
agents, we are, most of us, reason-responsive and thus
to some extent reformable, deterrable, and capable of
offering  crime  victims  remorse  and  restitution  (the  
aims  of  restorative  justice).  Incarceration  and  other  
sanctions  (fines,  GPS  monitoring,  community  ser-
vice) can therefore be justified if they serve these ends,
but  should  not  inflict  suffering  and  harm  beyond  
what’s  consequentially  necessary,  what  Caruso  and  
Pereboom  call  the  “principle  of  least  infringement”  
(206). In some cases very little, if any, suffering might
be required. This might frustrate our retaliatory incli-
nations (thanks to evolution we all have them to some
extent)  which  want  harm-doers  to  be  paid  back  in  
kind. The revisionist prescription for reform thus faces
some tough opposition in our own psychology, oppo-
sition that can be softened by dwelling on determin-
ism. Valerie Hardcastle does exactly that in her essay,
concluding that a sea change in criminal justice might
be  in  the  offing  under  pressure  from  neuroscience:
If  we  know  our  brains  cause  our  behavior,  and  
our brains are the way they are because of their
underlying genetics and previous life experienc-
es, it becomes difficult to maintain that punish-
ment as retribution for behavior is a just or even
a coherent notion. (326)
The  revisionists  also  recommend  that  the  criminal  
justice system focus on crime prevention as much or
more  than  on  punishment.  We  should  take  a  public  
health approach to addressing criminogenic risk fac-
tors,  applying  behavioral  and  developmental  neuro-
science to assist in creating nurturing, not punishing,
environments. Understanding and accepting that in-
dividuals are fully a function of formative conditions,
not self-caused, should help motivate such a shift in
priorities.
Dissenting to much of this is the redoubtable law schol-
ar Stephen Morse, who although a good-enough-for-
government-work determinist, stoutly resists any sug-
gestion that neuroscience or determinism should lead
us to abandon retribution (and has been doing so for
years  –  see  
here
).  Although  he  provides  no  citations  
for the claim, he contends that it isn’t retribution, but
rather consequentialist deterrence and incapacitation
that  are  primarily  responsible  for  the  punitive  over-
reach  of  our  criminal  justice  system  (347).  He  takes  
Caruso and Pereboom’s chapter extensively to task for
offering  what  he  calls  a  “pale  simulacrum”  of  human  
agency (346) in which nothing is really up to the per-
son. If so, then what, he asks, could ground our liberty,
rights, dignity and autonomy? (348) If we aren’t really
reasons-responsive (as he says Caruso and Pereboom
claim), then “we are simply creatures to be manipulat-
ed in the right ways to do the right thing rather than
being genuinely autonomous agents.” (347)
Whether retributivism or consequentialism is primar-
ily responsible for our overly punitive criminal justice
system  is  an  important  question  up  for  research  and  
debate.  But  what’s  not  in  question  in  my  mind  is  
that  Morse  seriously  misrepresents  Caruso  and  Per-
eboom’s characterization of agency. A fair reading of
their  chapter  shows  that  their  view  of  the  person  is  
anything but shallow, and that they hold reasons-re-
sponsiveness in high regard. Morse also misrepresents
their  proposals  for  reform  as  unheedful  of  potential  
consequentialist  excess;  instead,  I  found  that  they  
specifically address concerns about manipulation and
threats to liberty and civil rights. Lastly, Morse could
be pressed on the question of retributive desert: what

precisely is it about our being reasons-responsive and
autonomous that entails we deserve, as he believes we
do,  to  suffer  for  our  wrong-doings?  On  Morse’s  ac-
count the primary aim of the law is to be action-guid-
ing  (335),  a  forward-looking  proposition,  so  it  isn’t  
obvious  how  punishment  that  
ignores
  consequences  
–    the  essence  of  desert-based  retribution  –  fits  in.  
Looking carefully at his chapter, I could find no clear
defense of basic desert, only rhetorical gestures in its
general direction.
Eddy  Nahmias,  on  the  other  hand,  offers  a  limited,  
consequentialist  defense  of  desert  in  the  context  of  
moral re-education:
While this view does not advocate wrong-doers
suffering
for the sake of
suffering, as some define
retributive  punishment,  it  does  advocate  that  
criminals deserve to suffer to the extent that such
suffering  is  a  constitute  [sic]  feature  of  these  
communicative goals of punishing them – for in-
stance, suffering may be a necessary feature (not
just a side effect) of the process of coming to un-
derstand the harm one has done and feeling and
demonstrating appropriate remorse for it. (origi-
nal emphasis, 265-6)
This  raises  questions  about  the  role  of  suffering  in  
moral re-education: to what extent is criminal punish-
ment as currently applied productive or counter-pro-
ductive  when  instilling  social  norms?  What  sorts  of  
punishments, for which sorts of subjects, and in what
sorts of facilities? And does the redefinition of desert
in  consequentialist  terms  (something  also  suggested  
by philosopher Daniel Dennett in his defense of pun-
ishment  –  see  
Caruso
  on  that)  simply  provide  cover  
for  acting  on  our  retributive  inclinations?  Ditching  
talk of desert altogether seems to me the safer, better
course if we want to keep those inclinations in check.
Nahmias  himself  favors  dialing  back  on  retribution,  
which he says is incited by the American infatuation
with  unrealistic,  unlimited  (that  is,  libertarian)  free  
will, to which much of this book serves as an antidote.
Conclusion
Rounding  out  the  collection  are  two  very  different  
essays,  one  by  physicist  Sean  (“
Big  Picture
”)  Carroll  
on  the  cosmic  context  of  existentialism,  the  other  a  
real-world case study in the experimental philosophy
(“xphi”) of agency by philosopher Thomas Nadelhof-
fer and psychologist Jennifer Wright. The latter con-
tribution gives us a tour of the methodological pitfalls
of  researching  the  potential  impact  of  neuroscience  
on  beliefs  about  free  will,  beliefs  which  it  turns  out  
are rather robust and not easily manipulated, at least
not by exposing subjects to anti-free will and anti-du-
alism  literature.  The  lesson  Nadelhoffer  and  Wright  
draw from this (besides the need for more and better
designed  research,  of  course)  is  that  worries  about  a  
rapid rise in neuro-anxiety might be overblown: peo-
ple  will  continue  to  believe  in  soul  control  whatever  
science throws at them. Perhaps, but failure to under-
mine belief in free will in experimental settings may
not  be  the  best  predictor  of  how  that  belief  might  
change  in  response  to  cultural  trends,  including  the  
rise of smart machines and advances in the neurobiol-
ogy of behavior. We shall see.
Carroll’s piece (chapter 16 of 18) could have gone first
in the book because it sets the grand philo-scientific
stage on which the drama of human action takes place.
Surveying  classical  mechanics,  quantum  physics,  the  
arrow of time, and the nature of emergent phenomena,
Carroll finds no contradiction between the existence
of meaning and purpose on the human scale and the
fact that “modern science has thoroughly undermined
any hopes for a higher purpose or meaning inherent
in  the  universe  itself.”  (305)  Still,  appreciating  that  
the human project of finding meaning exists within a
fantastically larger, purposeless context might provoke
some invigorating existentialist astonishment, should
that be to your taste.
Although  I’ve  tried  to  touch  on  the  major  themes  
broached by each of the contributors, the above is just
a  small  sampling  of  the  scientific  and  philosophical  
content  you’ll  find  in  this  book.  In  addressing  third  
wave  existentialist  concerns,  many  hot  topics  in  the  
study  of  mind  and  action  come  up,  so  readers  will  
end up philo-scientifically
au courant
. They’ll also find
good naturalistic philosophical practice: concepts and
arguments  are  constrained  by  having  some  sort  of  
empirical relevance and plausibility. Lastly, despite (or
perhaps because of ) the disagreements that arise, this
collection illustrates the range of thoughtful, sane re-
sponses available to us as we confront the naturaliza-
tion of the self and behavior. Neuro-anxiety need not
overwhelm us. Indeed, with help from Caruso, Flan-
agan & Co. we might even achieve some measure of
neuro-equanimity.
