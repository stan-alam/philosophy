## notes on 'Super Intelligence'

```text
Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies is a 2014 book by the Swedish philosopher
Nick Bostrom from the University of Oxford. It argues that if machine brains surpass
human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could replace
humans as the dominant lifeform on Earth. Sufficiently intelligent machines could
improve their own capabilities faster than human computer scientists,[2] and the
outcome could be an existential catastrophe for humans.[3]
