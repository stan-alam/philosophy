## notes on 'world without mind'

```text
Over the past few decades there has been a revolution in terms of who controls knowledge
and information. This rapid change has imperiled the way we think. Without pausing to
consider the cost, the world has rushed to embrace the products and services of four titanic
corporations. We shop with Amazon; socialize on Facebook; turn to Apple for entertainment;
and rely on Google for information. These firms sell their efficiency and purport to make the
world a better place, but what they have done instead is to enable an intoxicating level of
daily convenience. As these companies have expanded, marketing themselves as champions of
individuality and pluralism, their algorithms have pressed us into conformity and laid
waste to privacy. They have produced an unstable and narrow culture of misinformation,
and put us on a path to a world without private contemplation, autonomous thought, or
solitary introspection—a world without mind. In order to restore our inner lives, we
must avoid being coopted by these gigantic companies, and understand the ideas that
underpin their success.

Elegantly tracing the intellectual history of computer science—from Descartes and the
enlightenment to Alan Turing to Stuart Brand and the hippie origins of today’s Silicon
Valley—Foer exposes the dark underpinnings of our most idealistic dreams for technology.
The corporate ambitions of Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, he argues, are trampling
longstanding liberal values, especially intellectual property and privacy. This is a
 nascent stage in the total automation and homogenization of social, political, and
 intellectual life. By reclaiming our private authority over how we intellectually
 engage with the world, we have the power to stem the tide.
