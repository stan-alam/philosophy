## notes on the 'existential cafe'

```text
From the best-selling author of How to Live, a spirited account of one of the twentieth century’s major
intellectual movements and the revolutionary thinkers who came to shape it

Paris, 1933: three contemporaries meet over apricot cocktails at the Bec-de-Gaz bar on the rue Montparnasse.
They are the young Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and longtime friend Raymond Aron, a fellow philosopher
who raves to them about a new conceptual framework from Berlin called Phenomenology. “You see,” he says,
“if you are a phenomenologist you can talk about this cocktail and make philosophy out of it!”

It was this simple phrase that would ignite a movement, inspiring Sartre to integrate Phenomenology into
his own French, humanistic sensibility, thereby creating an entirely new philosophical approach inspired by
themes of radical freedom, authentic being, and political activism. This movement would sweep through the
jazz clubs and cafés of the Left Bank before making its way across the world as Existentialism.
