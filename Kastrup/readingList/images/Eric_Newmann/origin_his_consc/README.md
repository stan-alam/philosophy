One more book I really wanted to ask you guys about, and it follows nicely from my other post on The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Julian Jaynes, (I promise I won't turn all my posts into book reviews haha) is called The Origins and History of Consciousness by Erich Neumann first published in 1949.
Just like in Jaynes' book, the idea in Neumann's classic is that we were not always conscious. In fact, Neumann goes further and argues that we were not conscious until we became complete human beings.
He gives us this interesting concept where he mentions 'ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' 
which is just a fancy way of saying that whatever happened in the course of evolutionary history in terms of psychic 
development we relive over the course of our development. So, in a sense, wherever you are in your particular lifespan and psychic 
development you can actually point to a period in the historic past in which your psyche is actually stuck. In a sense, you are a 
trapped passenger, until at last you can 'pop out' so to speak. We all have a 'time vampire' keeping us stuck.
We live in two worlds: the conscious world, the objective one that science can measure, but we also live in an unconscious one, ruled by 
the psyche, the world of stories. So we can tell ourselves a story using science ("The world started here using these chemical processes, 
life then evolved, etc), but from the psyche's perspective that's not the same story; it tells its own story. 
This gets fairly weird so let's slow down. Science may tell you that life began with the big bang through which chemical compounds found 
connection and life evolved but to the psyche life began with "Let there be light". It began with a story. Neumann argues that whenever 'light' 
is mentioned in a creation myth that refers to the coming of consciousness. The story of the creation of life IS NOT the same as the story of the 
creation of consciousness. And the latter may not even depend on the former (consciousness may exist independent of a physical vehicle). I know it 
may seem to be getting stranger but hang in there, it gets more interesting. So when 'God' said "Let there be light" it did not refer to the creation 
of the universe but instead that's when we became aware of ourselves. So it begs the question as to what was there before we became conscious, before 
we were sentient. Well, the Judeo Christian story tells us that 'the world was without form and void'. That's one perspective. So where were we? We 
were ouroboros, the serpent or dragon eating its own tail. There was no time, there was no space, there was no perception of anything, there was no 
beginning, no end, you just are.
Wittgenstein famously wrote that "The limits of my language are the limits of my world", the French poet Paul Val√©ry wrote, "To see is to forget the
 name of the thing one sees."
So you exist but the ouroboros also exists. How do we tie those two things together? Well interestingly Neumann mentions a term called 'ouroboric incest' 
which states that we as human beings, who look out into the world, desire to be unconscious. We actually want to return back to eternity, to the 
womb from whence we came. We all desire 'death'.
Cessation of consciousness, as in death, is the exact same thing as 'paradise'. Consciousness itself is defined by pain and suffering, it happens 
as a condition of being enveloped in a body of flesh. The opposite of this, the end of consciousness, becomes almost a secret wish. 
So, built into each of us is this nihilistic seed that craves dissolution, or put another way, your desire to be one with 
the Great One is actually a desire for death.
What are we to do?
Great book. Highly recommended.
